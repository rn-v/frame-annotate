Fox News host Kayleigh McEnany said migrants flipping the bird to the camera after allegedly committing crimes was becoming a ""trend"" in the U.S., referencing an incident where a group of illegal immigrants allegedly attacked two NYC police officers.
A 26-year-old Palestinian migrant is facing hate crime charges in New York after police say he stole a homeowner's U.S. and Israeli flags out of his yard and then beat the man to the ground while yelling antisemitic slurs.
""This is about coming to this country and demanding the food is not good enough, this is about coming to this country and crawling through spaces undetected so that they can break more laws when they get here, because otherwise they would go through a port of entry,"" Fox New's Harris Faulkner said. ""What this is about is when people break our laws, they put their middle finger up to the cameras.""
AMERICANS AREN’T SAFE WITH BIDEN'S OPEN BORDER AND THE SYSTEM IS ‘FLASHING RED’
""What they have in common is the way they got here, that is what we’re talking about right now,"" she continued. ""The type here, you close the border, you get caught up on the last three years with eight million coming into the country, you get caught up on your justices being able to go through which claims are asylum and which people need to be deported right away. Of course you know how I feel, if you came illegally, we send you back and figure out how to do it the legal way. Get to the back of the line.""
Fox News' Emily Compagno said the attack was on all of America.
""The video of your neighbor, of my neighbor, being attacked on his lawn is not only an assault, but an attack on all of America. Isn't that the whole point that we're talking about? That flagrance, the absolute lack of respect… the lack of respect for anyone trying to enforce the laws,"" she said.
""There is a problem now to all of us Americans. It is illegal immigration, and it is the fact that in every breath of this commander-in-chief, Americans are being prioritized last and that attack is just the tip of the iceberg. When is it going to be you or your neighbor next?"" she added.
NYPD CHIEF BLASTS MIGRANTS' ATTACK ON OFFICERS AS MUGSHOTS OF SUSPECTS RELEASED
Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman sounded the alarm on the crisis as well on Tuesday.
""These are not the type of people who come to America like my great-grandparents did, like your great-grandparents and grandparents and parents who came to America to kiss the ground,""Blakeman told reporters.
""Instead, they spit on our flag, they trample on our values and they commit crimes. And they do so at taxpayer expense.""

The three-day festival is a first of its kind. It is being hosted by a number of organizations including, Hecho en Westwood. Hecho in Westwood is a resource-sharing network of Latinx/BIPOC-owned food-based businesses, artists, and other organizations mostly based in Westwood.
Sarahi Hernandez, one of the organizers of the event, says this event means a lot to the community.
""We've done Dia de los Muertos events in the past, but never at this capacity. We were able to get a grant that let us activate and do this for our community,"" said Hernandez.
All of it is thanks to a Denver Economic Development and Opportunity grant.
""It is a grant to activate the community, to activate spaces, businesses and you know us being predominately Latino, Mexican, Chicano that presence is really important in this neighborhood,"" said Hernandez.
To this community, Dia de los Muertos is more than just a holiday. It is tradition.
""This is something that not a lot of people, not a lot of communities get to experience, to see and really have a history rooted ...so I think it is beautiful that this generation wants to preserve it,"" said Hernandez.
The three-day Muertos en Westwood festival concluded on Sunday, Nov. 5.
The final day of the festival featured modern and traditional interpretations of the holiday. The focus was on the Festival de las Catrinas, giving people the opportunity to participate in several activities. Those activities include flower crown making, face painting, lucha libre and Mariachi music. Sangre de Mexico will end the weekend with a presentation on Catrinas."

Trackhouse Racing is expanding, but not in NASCAR.
The team, co-owned by former driver Justin Marks and Grammy award winning artist Pitbull, announced Tuesday they will field a MotoGP World Championship team beginning in the 2024 season.
Trackhouse will manage the team from the U.S. but operate in Noale, Italy in an alliance with motorcycle manufacturer Aprilia and the Piaggio Group.
“This is a monumental moment for Trackhouse Entertainment Group,” said the 42-year-old Marks.
“It has been in the ethos of Trackhouse since the very first day to put in the work, have the vision, and deploy the enthusiasm and passion necessary to build one of the most valuable motorsports entertainment companies in the world. Our entry into the MotoGP World Championship is another step in the execution of that vision.""
The rumors that Trackhouse was negotiating for ownership of the RNF Racing team came a few weeks ago after the team’s principal, Razlan Razali, announced his departure and just prior to the series conducting testing in Valencia, Spain.
Founded in 1949, the MotoGP World Championship sanctioned by Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) with headquarters in Mies, Switzerland, is the premier motorcycle racing series in the world with eleven teams each fielding two riders. The 2024 schedule includes 22 races in 19 countries across five continents, The season begins on March 10 in Qatar with an American race at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas on April 14.
Trackhouse was founded by Marks in 2020 as a one car team with driver Daniel Suarez. After acquiring the support of Pitbull and the assets of Chip Ganassi Racing in 2021 the team added driver Ross Chastain to its lineup.
In 2022 the team added its Project91 initiative as a way to bring racers from other motorsports into NASCAR. Drivers there have included former F1 champion Kimi Raikkonen and most recently Australian Supercars champion Shane van Gisbergen who won the inaugural NASCAR street race in Chicago earlier this year.
Trackhouse Racing will be the only American team in the MotoGP class. The U.S. however has a long list of successful riders including Eddie Lawson, Kenny Roberts, Freddie Spencer, Wayne Rainey, Kevin Schwantz, Kenny Roberts Jr, Freddie Spencer, Randy Mamola, Colin Edwards and the late Nicky Hayden.
The rider line-up for the team of Raul Fernandez and Miguel Oliveira will remain the same. Trackhouse Racing revealed their bike presentation Tuesday showing off an all-American scheme with the RS-GP bike clad in red, white and blue, with white stars on the front fairing.
The move for Trackhouse with co-owner Pitbull whose nickname is “Mr. Worldwide” allows the team to step up to a truly global stage.
“We feel that MotoGP is perfectly positioned for massive growth in the coming years not only in the United States, but internationally,” Marks said.
“It has all the ingredients necessary to continue its rise to global prominence: a thrilling on-track product, aspirational stars, unmatched fan and partner experience, and an environment that’s fan-friendly and welcoming.”
On the NASCAR side, Trackhouse will start its fourth NASCAR Cup Series season in February."

The International Cricket Council (ICC) has proposed a new revenue sharing model for the 2024-27 cycle to be voted on at its July board meeting in Durban.
According to figures leaked to Cricinfo, cricket's financial engine India would alone claim 38.5%, primarily in recognition of its contribution to the commercial revenue pot.
The 12 full members of the ICC would collectively take 88.81% with the rest distributed among 94 associate members.
The ICC has not commented on the figures, though general manager Wasim Khan said on Monday all members would get more money under the proposed model than in the past.
Pakistan have already made clear their opposition to the model in its current shape and resentment is rumbling among other, less developed, cricketing nations.
Sumod Damodar, one of the three associate member representatives on the ICC Chief Executives' Committee, said the proposal would not meet the needs of associate members.
""If what is being proposed and discussed is likely to be the outcome then, as an associate member representative, I would be (disappointed),"" he told Reuters.
""There are numerous practical reasons why it would be inadequate for associate members.""
Damodar, vice chairman of Botswana's board, said associate members who have earned one-day international (ODI) status need more money to sustain their high-performance programmes, while the others need cash to bridge the gap.
Citing the rapid rise of Nepal in men's cricket and Thailand in the women's game, Damodar said more countries would step up if they were given the required financial support.
Vanuatu Cricket Association Chief Executive Tim Cutler said the proposed model would only accentuate the inequality between cricket's haves and have-nots.
""The new model is now even more heavily weighted towards the bigger cricketing nations, and there is a risk that the proposed changes will exacerbate this imbalance, putting the future of the game at further risk,"" Cutler told Reuters.
""The sad reality is, cricket will not grow beyond its current corners of the world ... if the allocation of the game’s global funds aren't more equally allocated with a view to actually growing the game.""
With full members having 12 of the 17 total votes on the ICC board, Cutler said diverting funds away from themselves, or making independent decisions for the good of the game, would be like ""turkeys voting for Christmas"".
The ICC did not respond to a request for comment when asked about the concerns of the associate members.
'STRONGER AND RICHER'
Former ICC President Ehsan Mani said there was a lack of vision at the governing body in its approach to developing cricketing nations, despite the huge commercial potential of some of them.
""One of the biggest risks for global cricket is its over-dependence on one country, India, for a major part of the revenues generated,"" the former Pakistan Cricket Board chairman told Reuters.
""Countries like the USA and the Middle East and, in longer term, China would bring enormous benefits to the ICC, its members and the global game. World cricket would be stronger and richer for it.""
For Mani, India grabbing the lion's share of ICC revenues ""makes no sense"" and he advocated equal shares for all full members.
""World cricket needs a strong West Indies, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Pakistan,"" he added.
""Cricket in Zimbabwe has suffered due to lack of funds as have Ireland and Afghanistan. Lack of investment in some of these countries will make the game unsustainable and world cricket will be poorer for it.""

Please enter a valid email address.
A Georgia judge on Friday ruled that embattled District Attorney Fani Willis needs to remove her ex-lover and special prosecutor from the case, or step aside herself, scolding her for ""making poor choices"" and having ""tremendous lapse in judgment.""
In the 23-page order, Judge Scott McAfee said that lawyers for former President Trump and several co-defendants charged in the sweeping 2020 election interference case ""failed to meet their burden of proving"" an ""actual conflict of interest in this case.""
But McAfee said that the established record of evidence ""highlights the appearance of impropriety"" that infects the prosecution team unless special prosecutor Nathan Wade is removed, or Willis herself steps aside.
Here are five key takeaways from the court order:
JUDGE RULES FANI WILLIS MUST STEP ASIDE FROM TRUMP CASE OR FIRE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR NATHAN WADE
1. Judge McAfee calls Willis' behavior in court testimony 'unprofessional'
McAfee denied the co-defendants' motion to have Willis disqualified from the case, saying they lacked sufficient evidence that Willis ""acquired a personal stake in the prosecution, or that her financial arrangements had any impact on the case.""
However, he added that his finding ""is by no means an indication that the Court condones this tremendous lapse in judgment or the unprofessional manner of the District Attorney’s testimony during the evidentiary hearing.""
""Rather, it is the undersigned’s opinion that Georgia law does not permit the finding of an actual conflict for simply making bad choices – even repeatedly – and it is the trial court’s duty to confine itself to the relevant issues and applicable law properly brought before it,"" he said.
Last month, Willis made a surprise court appearance during the two-day evidentiary hearing and, while on the witness stand, verbally sparred with lawyers for hours — at one point, prompting the judge to threaten to strike her testimony. She also raised eyebrows for appearing to be wearing her dress backwards.
2. Judge points to Georgia legislature, state bar and ethics board for 'unanswered questions' about Willis' affair
The judge wrote in his order, ""Other forums or sources of authority such as the General Assembly, the Georgia State Ethics Commission, the State Bar of Georgia, the Fulton County Board of Commissioners, or the voters of Fulton County may offer feedback on any unanswered questions that linger.""
""But those are not the issues determinative to the Defendants’ motions alleging an actual conflict,"" he said.
A Georgia state senate special committee formed in January to investigate Willis has already held one hearing, in which attorney Ashleigh Merchant – who led the allegations in court against Willis – testified that Wade's cellphone data indicated that he had made midnight trips to Willis' condo before he was hired.
The Georgia House of Representatives also passed a bill earlier this year that would revive the Prosecuting Attorneys' Qualifications Commission, which could be used as a way to oust Willis.
A Fulton County ethics board that was scheduled to hear complaints filed against Willis earlier this month backtracked after finding that it lacked jurisdiction. But complaints against both Willis and Wade are still pending before the Georgia state bar.
3. McAfee scolds Fani Willis' public statements, including ‘improper' church speech and ‘playing the race card’
Defendants had argued that Willis' several public statements on the case were prejudicial. McAfee said that some of those comments, including Willis' ""unorthodox decision to make on-the-record comments, and authorize members of her staff to do likewise, to authors intent on publishing a book about the special grand jury’s investigation during the pendency of this case,"" didn't warrant her disqualification.
But McAfee said that Willis' racially charged rhetoric about ""playing the race card"" during a speech at a church service was ""legally improper.""
""Providing this type of public comment creates dangerous waters for the District Attorney to wade further into. The time may well have arrived for an order preventing the State from mentioning the case in any public forum to prevent prejudicial pretrial publicity,"" he said.
4. Nathan Wade's 'willingness' to 'conceal' his relationship with Willis
Judge McAfee said that Wade's ""patently unpersuasive explanation"" about inaccurate statements he submitted to the court about his divorce ""indicates a willingness on his part to wrongly conceal his relationship with the District Attorney.""
JUDGE DISMISSES SOME COUNTS AGAINST TRUMP IN FANI WILLIS ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE
5. Key witness testimony that Willis and Wade's affair began prior to his hiring is tossed
McAfee said he was ""unable to place any stock"" in the testimony of Terrance Bradley, the former law partner and Wade's divorce attorney who was considered a key witness of the defense team trying to prove Wade had been romantically involved with Willis prior to his hiring.
Bradley, when pressed under oath, said he could not recall several details and timelines about conversations he had with former client Wade about Wade's romantic relationship with Willis.
At one point, he was questioned about a text message exchange in which he said Willis’ relationship with Wade had ""absolutely"" started before he was hired in the DA’s office in 2021. But later in court he claimed he was ""speculating"" in those comments.
In his order on Friday, McAfee said Bradley’s ""inconsistencies, demeanor, and generally non-responsive answers left far too brittle a foundation upon which to build any conclusions.""
FANI WILLIS WHO 'RELISHED IN' DONALD TRUMP PROSECUTION SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM CASE FOR ILLICIT AFFAIR: EXPERTS
""While prior inconsistent statements can be considered as substantive evidence under Georgia law, Bradley’s impeachment by text message did not establish the basis for which he claimed such sweeping knowledge of Wade’s personal affairs,"" McAfee said.
Robin Yeartie, a former ""good friend"" of Willis and past employee at the DA's office, testified in court that she had ""no doubt"" Willis and Wade's relationship started in 2019, after the two met at a conference.
She testified to observing Willis and Wade ""hugging"" and ""kissing"" and showing ""affection"" prior to November 2021 and that she had no doubt that the two were in a ""romantic"" relationship starting in 2019 and lasting until she and Willis last spoke in 2022.
Judge McAfee in his order Friday said that ""while the testimony of Robin Yearti raised doubts about the State’s assertions, it ultimately lacked context and detail.""
""[N]either side was able to conclusively establish by a preponderance of the evidence when the relationship evolved into a romantic one,"" he added.

Still, the judge said that ""an odor of mendacity remains,"" and added that ""reasonable questions about whether the District Attorney and her hand-selected lead SADA [special assistant district attorney] testified untruthfully about the timing of their relationship further underpin the finding of an appearance of impropriety and the need to make proportional efforts to cure it.""
It has not been announced whether Willis will choose to remove Wade from the case or step aside."

By opening a CD or high-yield savings account in 2024 you can start earning more interest on your money. Getty Images
Americans continue to feel the pinch in their wallets when paying high prices for necessities like food, gas and housing. However, the inflation rate is trending downward after peaking at 9% in June 2022. The Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hike schedule to curb inflation appears to be working, with the year-over-year rate dropping to 3.2% in October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Still, interest rates remain elevated, which could factor into your year-end financial planning. For example, saving in high-yield deposit accounts and paying down high-interest debt could benefit your personal bottom line.
What other smart changes should you make going forward? Below, we'll break down five financial moves to consider—and another five to avoid—to improve your financial footing going forward.
Start by earning more interest on your money with a high-yield savings account now.
5 financial moves to make in 2024
Here are five financial moves you should strongly consider making in the new year.
Open a CD
Certificates of deposit (CDs) are a reliable and low-risk way to grow your savings. With CDs, you agree to keep your money in the account for a specific period, from three months to five years, in exchange for an interest rate generally higher than traditional savings accounts. And with interest rates still high, you can earn a solid return on your money, with rates up to 5.5% or higher. If you have money in a regular savings account you don't need to access soon, you may grow your savings faster by moving it into a CD account. However, if you withdraw money before your account's maturity date, you could incur an early withdrawal penalty.
Explore your CD options here to see how much more you could be earning.
Open a high-yield savings account
As its name implies, high-yield savings accounts earn strong yields, especially compared to traditional savings accounts. The FDIC's latest data shows the average yield on savings accounts at a paltry 0.46%. However, you can typically earn a substantially higher rate with a high-yield savings account. The best accounts available in November range from around 4.30% to 4.10% on a $1,000 deposit. If you're earning less than 1% in a traditional savings account, transferring your funds into a high-yield savings account could make sense.
""High-yield savings accounts are best for emergency savings and short-term savings goals,"" says Brittany Pederson, the director of deposit and payment operations at Georgia's Own Credit Union. As Peterson points out, you can also access your money anytime without an early withdrawal penalty. ""If you need your savings in the near future, whether for something planned or unexpected, you have a much greater ability to access it in a high-yield savings account.""
Learn more about your high-yield savings account options here now.
Pay down high-interest credit cards
Paying down high-interest credit card debt is another smart financial move in 2024. Remember, high interest rates compound your debt quickly and make it harder to pay off. By wiping out your debt, you'll free up more money for your savings, retirement contributions or other investments. A 0% introductory balance transfer credit card can help by giving you an interest-free period of up to 21 months, allowing you to pay down the principal balance faster. Debt consolidation loans can also be a valuable debt reduction tool. These personal loans usually come with fixed interest rates lower than most credit card rates.
Get life insurance to protect loved ones
Life insurance can ensure your loved ones aren't left with financial burdens when you pass. It can be especially valuable if you have dependents, including children, non-working spouses or aging parents. Life insurance can replace lost income and cover living expenses to help your dependents avoid a financial catastrophe. While term life insurance is typically less expensive and can help cover your bases, whole life policies accumulate cash value over time and provide an extra financial resource later in life.
Build an emergency fund
Experts often recommend building an emergency fund covering three to six months of living expenses. This rainy day fund can provide you with a financial safety net you can draw from if you unexpectedly lose your income, incur an unforeseen medical expense or face another unplanned financial burden. Having adequate cash available can help you address a financial crisis without disrupting your budget or resorting to high-interest debt like credit cards to meet your costs.
5 financial moves to avoid in 2024
And here are some steps you should try to avoid making next year.
Using your credit card
According to the Federal Reserve, the average credit card interest rate is 22.77% and many card issuers charge up to 30% interest or more. Of course, you can avoid paying interest by paying your balance in full by your due date. However, if you tend to make minimum payments and carry a balance from month to month, it's best not to use your credit card for non-essential spending.
Applying for high-interest debt
High-interest credit cards and loans, including payday loans, can quickly become a burden. For example, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the fee structure for payday loans often equates to an annual percentage rate (APR) of nearly 400% for a two-week loan, making them extremely challenging to repay. The compounding interest on high-interest debt could result in paying significantly more than you borrowed and lead to a cycle of debt that's hard to escape.
Not maxing out your 401(k)
""I believe the worst financial move people can make in 2024 is not taking full advantage of their employers' match on their retirement plan,"" says Lawrence Sprung, CFP, founder of Mitlin Financial and author. ""There are not many times in life that you can receive 'free' money, but this is one of them."" If possible, contribute up to your employer match each paycheck. For example, if your employer offers a 3% match, contribute at least that amount per paycheck. Aim to gradually increase your contributions, ideally to 10-20% of your paycheck if possible.
Being complacent with money issues
In tough financial times, it's easy to get discouraged. But don't ignore any financial issues, advises Marcus Holzberg, CFP at Holzberg Wealth Management. ""I would say don't let multiple problems you have with your financial life compound, or say, 'It'll sort itself out.' If you have questions or concerns about your financial life, make 2024 the year where you get financially organized and figure out the issues you may be having,"" says Holzberg.
Putting all your financial resources into a single investment or sector
Putting all your financial eggs into one basket can be risky and lead to substantial losses. For example, when the dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s, many investors heavily invested in tech stocks saw their portfolios plummet when the Nasdaq Composite dropped 78% in 30 months. That's why most financial advisors recommend diversifying your portfolio with a mix of stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets. Adding a sliver of gold, typically no more than 5% to 10%, can also help to stabilize your portfolio.
The bottom line
With the new year fast approaching, now is the perfect time to review your financial situation and set goals for 2024. Consulting your tax accountant or financial advisor can help you minimize taxes and ensure any moves you're considering fit within your overall financial plan and advance you toward your goals."
bce9388a-c849-4b65-a3f0-f5ead3ac8504,Thousands lose power as post-tropical cyclone Lee batters New England and Canada,"Post-tropical cyclone Lee started to batter New England and eastern Canada with violent winds and relentless rains on Saturday, cutting off electricity to at least 200,000 while threatening to bring dangerous flooding on its path toward landfall.
While Lee was downgraded from hurricane status early on Saturday morning, the storm still boasts winds of 80mph, which is the “equivalent” of a category 1 hurricane, the Washington Post reported.
Forecasters issued a tropical storm warning for areas stretching from the New Hampshire-Maine border into Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. Meanwhile, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were under a hurricane watch.
President Joe Biden on Friday declared a state of emergency in Maine as Lee barrelled northward. Maine’s governor, Janet Mills, remarked on Friday: “I continue to strongly urge all Maine people, especially those Down East, to take the necessary precautions to stay safe as Hurricane Lee moves closer.”
The US’s National Hurricane Center (NHC) alerted residents of torrential downpours. “Heavy rainfall from Lee could produce localized urban and small stream flooding in eastern Maine into portions of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia from tonight into Saturday night,” the NHC said on Friday.
Meteorologists predict that Lee will make landfall on Saturday afternoon near or east of the US-Canada border, and then curve north-east along Atlantic Canada during the evening into Sunday. Lee – which at one point had achieved the highest intensity classification given to hurricanes, category 5 – battered Bermuda, the Bahamas and the US Virgin Islands with tropical storm conditions before moving northward, according to the Associated Press.
The NHC warned that Lee was poised to cause “life-threatening surf and rip current conditions” – with waves of up to 15ft in some areas of coastal Maine. The conditions threaten erosion in Maine, which is the US’s most densely forested state, as the AP noted.
The National Weather Service meteorologist Todd Foisy described the ground as saturated, further imperiling trees that had been weakened by summertime rains. “We have a long way to go, and we’re already seeing downed trees and power outages,” Foisy told the Associated Press.
Officials in Canada have predicted that Lee will not be as damaging as the tail end of Hurricane Fiona in 2021. Fiona’s waters washed homes into the Atlantic Ocean and cut off power to most of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
The AP said disastrous hurricanes are somewhat of an anomaly this far north. In 1938, the Great New England Hurricane packed winds as high as 186mph – with sustained gusts of 121mph – at the Blue Hill Observatory in Massachusetts.
However, meteorological authorities have described the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season as unprecedented. This summer’s uniquely warm sea surface temperatures – caused by the climate crisis – are fertile grounds for tropical storms and hurricanes.

a5a6de46-8954-4d3c-9564-a8058768826d,"Sikh recruit makes Marine Corps history, completing boot camp with turban, beard","One of America’s newest Marines made history Friday as the first Sikh to complete boot camp without having to shave his head or beard or give up the “articles of faith” that Sikhs consider sacred.
Private First Class Jaskirat Singh, 21, completed training at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego after a federal judge ordered the military service in April to accommodate the recruit’s religious practices. The order came nearly a year after three Sikhs and Jewish and Muslim recruits sued the Marines seeking religious accommodations.
The Army and Air Force accommodate Sikh recruits, attorney Giselle Klapper with the Sikh Coalition said, while the Navy offers more limited accommodations. The Marines were the most restrictive of the services.
The court order covered only Pfc. Singh, but Ms. Klapper said the group hopes the Marine Corps will extend the accommodation to all Sikh recruits.
“The Army has figured this out. The Air Force has figured this out. And so our hope is that the Marine Corps will figure this out,” she said.
The recruit, who hails from Houston, appeared at a video news conference wearing a Sikh turban to which the Marine Corps emblem was affixed as well as an “expert” badge indicating his prowess as a marksman. Early in his recruit training, he was selected as a squad leader, a coalition spokesman said, and remained one throughout the training period.
The new Marine said he expects to serve in the infantry.
“I’m proud to demonstrate that wearing a turban or a beard does not make me any different or less of a Marine and I intend to prove that in the future,” Pfc. Singh said. “My personal hope is that today’s events can show other young Sikhs that if they want to pursue a career in the military, they can do so while staying true to their faith.”
Pfc. Singh said his understanding of the Sikh faith’s principles “overlaps with my decision to serve my country” as a Marine. He said “many” of his fellow Sikhs served in the military.
“I want other Sikhs to know that their turbans, beards and other articles of faith don’t have to be an obstacle to any career, including one like mine,” he said.
The “articles of faith” that Sikhs wear include: kesh, or unshorn hair; kanga, a small comb; a steel bracelet called a kara; the kirpan, which resembles a small knife; and underwear known as kachera.
He credited his fellow recruits with supporting him during the struggle.
“They did ask questions” about his articles of faith, Pfc. Singh said, “I didn’t really mind explaining it to them. But it wasn’t like they were bullying me or anything. They were pretty much like, ‘Yo, that’s pretty cool, that’s dope.’ They were very supportive.”
He said his drill instructors “went into it with open minds” and “treated me no different than the other recruits.”
Pfc. Singh said he received “incentive training” assignments — essentially exercise tasks in response to minor infractions — “as much as anybody else.”

Because that would mean offending Muslim voters or left-wing activists. But the Biden administration, look, they're fine offending, even targeting Catholics and Christians of all denominations.
DC ARCHBISHOP JABS BIDEN AS ‘CAFETERIA CATHOLIC’ WHO ‘PICKS AND CHOOSES’ FOR HIS ‘POLITICAL ADVANTAGE’
Remember, it was back in 2022 that the FBI was considering the potential problems with traditional Catholics. And yesterday, the Biden team celebrated Trans Visibility Day despite its coinciding with Easter. Now, this isn't a day started by them. It began back in 2010, but they have fully embraced the day, even plastering it all over their social media accounts. But Biden, confused himself, has proven good at confusing others.
…
Because kids today aren't confused enough. But second point, if you're going to commemorate godlessness, at least have some respect for Christians and wait to do so another day. The left already celebrates godlessness 24/7 anyway, so an internationally designated day, week or month is frankly redundant.
…
While the White House did its best to brush off the Easter uproar, Christians do get the message loud and clear. But they already know that if they live their faith openly or frankly, if they ever post anything about biblical teachings on human sexuality, well, in this administration they'd be considered bigots or even, even potential domestic terrorists.

Now, everyone knows there's no room in the Biden administration at any level for traditional Christians who believe that the Bible is actually the word of God, but there is room for others."

Transcript
NIALA BOODHOO: Good morning! Welcome to Axios Today! It’s Tuesday, June 20th. I’m Niala Boodhoo. Today: the U.S. and China say they’ll stabilize relations. Plus, new summer reading recommendations. But first, America’s paternity leave patchwork – that’s today’s One Big Thing.
America’s paternity leave patchwork
NIALA: Over the weekend, millions celebrated Father's Day in the U.S. But when it comes to giving Dads paid time off to care for their new children, America lags behind. 63% of countries around the world provide fathers with paid parental leave. That's according to the World Policy Analysis Center. In the U.S., just 11 states have paid parental leave for all parents. Axios’ Erica Pandey is here with the big picture. Hi Erica.
ERICA PANDEY: Hi Niala.
NIALA: So when we're talking about the current state of paid parental leave for both mothers and fathers, what does that look like across the U.S.?
ERICA: So it's very much a patchwork, right? We've got, like you said, 11 states that have active laws. We have six more states that have passed laws, but they're not in effect yet. So 17 out of 50. And then in four of those states, it's not even a, a, a guaranteed thing. It's a voluntary thing, so workers can choose to purchase paid parental leave insurance is not something that they just get as table stakes.
NIALA: And how accessible is paternity leave for men, specifically if they're not in one of these states?
ERICA: It, it's not very accessible at all, right? I mean, only 25% of all workers have access to paid family leave. That's the birthing parent, that's the secondary parent, that's all workers. And 11% of workers don't even have the opportunity to take unpaid leave. That's according to the recruiting platform Zippia. So there's a lot of workers out there who can kind of cobble together sick time and you know, in vacation time. But what it means is that particularly dads are trying to come back to work as soon as possible. So another stat that really caught my eye was that 76% of fathers return to work full time in less than a week after welcoming a new baby. Compare that to the average of 6.3 weeks of paid leave that fathers take in the European Union, for example.
So there's a lot of complicated issues that are coming together here, you know, the big issue is that dads just aren't being given the opportunity or being encouraged to take time off. And, and, and that has stakes for, for dads, for their kids, for moms. And it's honestly very inequitable for moms too.
NIALA: I wanna get to that, but first, let's just talk about the consequences for dads. The New York Times reported that married fathers who take paternity leave are less likely to get divorced. What are some of those consequences for not having access to paid paternity leave?
ERICA: So those early weeks of a baby's life studies have shown are so crucial when it comes to building bonds with parents when it comes to their development later in their childhood and even as an adult. And for a father not to be a part of that, you know, really hurts the father and the child. And I think it can create a lot of strife in a, in a relationship if a dad has to go right back to work. And a mom is kind of, you know, at home trying to handle things alone. And I think it creates a lot of pain in marriages that doesn't need to happen if we were giving both parents the chance to sort of be there for those few weeks at least when it's a critical time for a new family.
NIALA: So Erica, we've been talking about laws. How many companies offer paid parental leave?
ERICA: Yeah, so Zippia says about 45% of companies offer it. And you know that's about half. That's way more than the share of states that offer it, and that's because paternity leave. Is gaining ground as a popular employee benefit at tech companies, at finance companies. Some of these, high skill professional workforce companies work from home companies, you know, as we call them sometimes. So there, there is some momentum there. But again, workers in other industries like logistics or the service industry or transportation, have far lower rates of coverage. So you're gonna start to see a two Americas for paternity leave quite soon if we're not already seeing it.
NIALA: If the U.S. is one of just seven countries in the entire world that doesn't guarantee paid maternity leave, how likely is it we're going to see change for paternity leave?
ERICA: Right. I mean, that's the huge, you know, question. The issue though is that, you know, we've seen study after study show that there is a cost to taking maternity leave. Moms who take time off to care for a new baby will have to deal with later promotions, slower raises, maybe even an increased risk of getting fired when they go back to work. And that's according to the Harvard Business Review. But experts say that if we gave fathers leave too, and both parents, you know, regardless of gender we're taking leave, that would lead to more equitable outcomes in the workforce because it's becomes much more of a commonplace thing. So, you know, those who push for paternity leave really do say that it's good for dads and really importantly, good for moms as well.
NIALA: Axios’ Erica Pandey. Thanks Erica.
ERICA: Thanks Niala.
NIALA: New data also shows that things don’t get easier for parents after those early days of parental leave. The cost of childcare in the U.S. has become an immense burden on American families, especially if they’re Black or Latino. The average annual nationwide cost for childcare for one toddler hit $10,600 in 2021 – with the highest price being in Washington D.C. at $24,400. The lowest is Mississippi at $4,400.
And according to a new report by the Annie E. Casey foundation, around 17% of Black children and 16% of Latino children aged five and under lived with a family member who had to change, quit or refuse a job in 2021 because of childcare issues.
In a moment, Blinken in Beijing.

U.S. and China say they’ll stabilize relations
NIALA: Welcome back to Axios Today! I’m Niala Boodhoo.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing yesterday – marking the first time in five years that a U.S. secretary of state has visited China.
Secretary Blinken had postponed his trip to China back in February because of the Chinese spy balloon incident. But this two day trip to Beijing was meant to stabilize strained ties between China and the U.S.
ANTONY BLINKEN: We have no illusions about the challenges of managing this relationship. There are many issues on which we profoundly even vehemently disagree.
NIALA: That’s Secretary Blinken in Beijing talking to reporters after meeting with President Xi Jinping. He said had a “robust conversation” with President Xi and that the nations had made progress towards better ties. He also met with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang and other senior Chinese officials. Blinken says Qin agreed to visit Washington at a ""suitable time.""
New summer reading recommendations
NIALA: As promised we’ll be bringing you summer reading recommendations from all kinds of people. Today we continue our series with New York Times opinion writer Jessica Grose. She’s the author of “Screaming on the Inside: The Unsustainability of American Motherhood.” We asked her for a couple of great reads for your summer.
JESSICA GROSE: Hi, I am Jess Grose. I'm an opinion writer at the New York Times. The first book that I wanna recommend is “The Forgotten Girls, A Memoir of Friendship and Lost Promise in Rural America” by Monica Potts. Potts grew up in Arkansas, and she traces how she diverged from her best friend Darcy. Monica went to a good college and she had an impressive career and a stable life, and Darcy just sort of languishes in her hometown and struggles with addiction and joblessness. And I really love the way that Monica gets the texture of teen girl friendships and how hard it is when you are that age and you and a best friend just grow apart. This book is for anybody who is interested in under told stories about what's happening for girls and women in America right now.
I also wanted to recommend on a lighter note, “Big Swiss,” which is a novel by Jen Beagin, and it's the weirdest and most wonderful fiction I have encountered for quite a while. It's about a woman who lives in a small town in upstate New York, where she's a transcriber for a new age sex therapist. She learns all of these, like, naughty and traumatic secrets about her fellow townspeople and she gets involved with them and in their personal lives in ways that she should not. And this book is for anyone who loves dark humor and satire about rich hippies.
NIALA: That’s New York Times opinion writer Jess Grose with her recommendations for summer reading: “The Forgotten Girls” by Monica Potts and “Big Swiss” by Jen Beagin. Jess’ own book is called “Screaming on the Inside: The Unsustainability of American Motherhood.”
That’s it for us today! By the way you can find all those book recommendation in our show notes or at our website. I’m Niala Boodhoo - thanks for listening - stay safe and we’ll see you back here tomorrow morning."

a83c1930-b0fb-4cfd-8263-94c1e245c168,ROOKE: Blaming Feminism Is Cope For Men Who Traded Masculinity For The Mirage Of Free Love,"It’s easy to look at wild-eyed feminists screaming about the compassion of abortion rights and paint them as the cause of society’s issues. But while the concept of human dignity is undoubtedly lost on them, feminists didn’t initiate the Western World’s current power dynamic. Men lost the Battle of the Sexes with an own goal.
Radical feminists were pushing the idea of “voluntary motherhood,” where someone could choose abortion if she didn’t want the consequence of premarital sex, long before the age of Free Love. But it wasn’t until the widespread acceptance of contraception and abortion in the 60s and 70s that men chose complacency over guardianship and unwittingly traded their most valuable asset — masculinity — for the promise of casual sex.
They should have known better than to make a deal with the Devil without reading the fine print. Of course, the “liberation” of women from the aftereffect of sex (children) would result in men going from masters of the universe to apologizing for their existence. It’s what happens when you snuff out your legacy without a second thought.
As intoxicating as it is to dream of a time where sex could be without consequences, it is the job of men as society’s protectors to maintain discipline. Men and women were created to be the balance of one another. Men are society’s guardians, and women are its nurturers. If women are pushing for Free Love and child murder, it’s incumbent on men to force them out of their selfish delusions. In return for being society’s champions, men receive power, honor, and duty.
Instead of being the voice of reason, men like Dr. Étienne-Émile Baulieu worked tirelessly on creating the pharmaceutical answer to ending life in a way easier to market to polite society than the gruesome reality of surgical abortion. Even hormonal contraception wasn’t a miracle for women’s reproductive health. Birth control has terrible side effects, like devastating infertility and suicidal depression.
However, we’re now seeing more women and physicians coming forward than ever before to reveal the many dangerous side effects of this pill that almost none of us were even warned about when prescribed it. — Evie Magazine (@Evie_Magazine) April 12, 2023
When women needed men to be resilient enough to prevent them from fulfilling their self-obsessed desires, they found men on their knees, begging to surrender. It’s not that women are feral creatures needing taming, but rather that they were pushing for a movement that ensured mutual destruction and needed to be stopped. (ROOKE: Where Did All The Good Men Go?)
Free Love erases the need for the family unit, depriving society of its natural order that allows men to be masculine and women to be feminine. Our culture is in desperate need of protective men. Cities are chaotic, schools are abuse factories and the U.S. government is financing it. Most days, it feels like there is no safe place for families. Men need a mission that forces them to no longer live for themselves, and there is no greater purpose to drive men to greatness than family. Without the family as the head of the societal hierarchy, men and women stay in a cycle of self-obsession, constantly feeding the rise of sexual pleasure as the highest need.
Men need strong women with conviction to keep them honorable in the same way women yearn for masculinity that will guard and guide them. Free Love offers men access to instant sexual gratification, but at the end of the day, it’s wasted energy. The Family is the only structure that provides stable, loyal love — the kind that wars are fought to protect.
Without duty, men become addicted to escapism like porn and video games because the reality of their vapid life is hard to stomach. Men of the Free Love age allowed the worst of women to gain mob rule, auctioning off the future of their family legacy for fleeting sex. Instead of admitting they failed society as watchmen, they blame feminism for the decline of masculinity in society. Admittedly, it is easy to do because feminists are rabid and obsessed with demonizing traditional life. Still, using them as a catchall for answering, “Where did all the strong men go?” hardly places blame where it’s due.
Every generation of men has a choice on where their priorities will lie. For several generations in America, men decided to close their eyes to the destruction of the family and enjoy the pleasure. It doesn’t have to be this way. Men have the choice to protect society or continue to uphold the mob. If we have any hope for future generations, we should demand men take up the yoke of leadership again because defending the Family leads to lasting legacies. Only then will men once again be able to echo the words of J.R.R. Tolkien’s character Faramir: “I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that which they defend.”"

A clip of Zegler from almost a year ago where she says the live-action “Snow White,” which will be released in March 2024, won’t be about the main character’s love story is going viral on TikTok.

“The original cartoon came out in 1937 and very evidently so,” she said in an interview with ExtraTV at the D23 Expo in September 2022. “There’s a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird. Weird. So we didn’t do that this time.”
In an interview with Variety at the same event, Zegler said that the reimagined “Snow White” reflects that it’s “no longer 1937.""
“She’s not going to be saved by the prince and she’s not going to be dreaming about true love,” the actor, who starred in the 2021 remake of “West Side Story,” said. “She’s dreaming about becoming the leader she knows she can be and the leader that her late father told her that she could be if she was fearless, fair, brave, and true.”
Zegler also said in an interview the same month that she was “scared” of the original “Snow White” and didn’t watch it again until she was cast in the remake.

“I think I watched it once and then I never picked it up again,” Zegler told Entertainment Weekly. “I’m being so serious. I watched it once and then I went on the ride at Disney World. It was called Snow White’s Scary Adventures ... was terrified of it; never revisited ‘Snow White’ again.”
TikToker @cosywithangie posted a video sharing clips of the interview and criticizing Zegler, saying not every woman wants to be a leader.
“Criticizing Disney princesses is not feminist,” the TikToker said in the video that has more than 1 million likes. “Not every woman is a leader. Not every woman wants to be a leader. Not every woman wants or craves power and that’s OK. It is not anti-feminist to want to fall in love, to want to get married, to want to stay at home, to be soft, to want to be a homemaker. None of these things make you less valuable as a person or a woman.”

Social media influencer Trisha Paytas also criticized Zegler’s comments. In a TikTok, Paytas said she was “so annoyed” with the “Snow White” remake.

“The fact that [Zegler] does not like Snow White, why? Why?” Paytas said. “There’s people that would pay money to play Snow White. Snow White is so iconic on so many levels, but you’re publicly saying you like nothing about the movie.”
Zegler hasn’t directly replied to the criticism — but she has filled her timeline on X, formerly Twittter, with supportive tweets. On Aug. 11, she tweeted that she hopes “the world becomes kinder” and then responded to another user, writing, “i am so exhausted. i think it’s over for me tbh.”
i am so exhausted. i think it's over for me tbh — rachel zegler (she/her/hers) (@rachelzegler) August 11, 2023
While some took offense to Zegler’s comments, others defended her on social media. One person pointed out that all of the live-action Disney remakes have attempted to be more feminist.
miss rachel zegler should not be in such hot water over saying snow white wasn’t ahead of it’s time (true), it wasn’t a childhood favorite of hers (honest), and the remake is going to attempt more feminism (something i think ALL of the other live-action princesses have said??) — julia (@juliaannecudney) August 13, 2023

Another person pointed out that the backlash is due to “the fact that the internet just hates successful women.”"
a401918d-1367-44ff-b2ea-c0812eb1066f,Proposed tenant protection law in Concord angers both sides,"On Tuesday the Concord City Council met to discuss a proposal to strengthen its tenant protection laws. It's an effort seven years in the making, but the Mayor was reminding the public that ""you can't always get what you want.""
The protections being discussed come too late for Betty Gabaldon. In 2018, after living in Concord for 18 years, she and her daughter were pushed out of their apartment without explanation.
""The owner just came in and gave everybody a 6-day notice,"" she said, ""and he didn't have to give us a reason why he was doing that. He just said it was because...he didn't even have to give us a reason.""
Gabaldon became a housing activist with the Todos Santos Tenants Union, and joined others at Tuesday's Concord City Council meeting. They've been pushing for rent control and just-cause eviction protections for seven years now but on that night, they were arguing that the proposed ordinance NOT be passed.
""It would not protect anybody,"" said Gabaldon. ""It wouldn't protect any tenants if this ordinance gets passed tonight.""
In the law, words matter. The ordinance calls for a 3% cap on rent increases, but would not apply to Accessory Dwelling Units. The activists said it's so vaguely defined that EVERY rental unit in the city could claim to be an ADU and be exempted. And they also take exception to the ease with which landlords can make a claim for ""fair return"" allowing them to get around the rent cap.
""Even if they're making a profit, they could ask for this fair return every year,"" Gabaldon said. ""So, this whole thing needs to be sent back.""
But Mayor Edi Birsan said he's not surpised there's dissatisfaction with the proposal...probably from both sides.
""Well, there's an old saying: 'If both sides are unhappy, it must be good deal,'"" he said. ""I like to think that if both sides are happy...maybe I'm on some strange meds!""
Birsan said he supports greater tenant protections. He said some landlords have treated people badly in pursuit of greed. And he recognizes that the rapid rise in rents is putting huge pressure on long time tenants to pay more or get out. But he said good government is not a ""zero-sum game"" where one side wins and the other loses.
""Both from the tenants' side and the landlords' side, they have to understand that they are in a compact to make the community work. And we are writing the rules so that people are reminded of what it is that makes the community work,"" said Birsan. ""And that's why we're having an intense time tonight. Because people's perceptions...and what people want...and what people need...are all three different subjects. ""
The mayor said he doubts any final decisions will be made until sometime in January. So, the city's new rent stabilization law will continue to be discussed--and argued over--for a while longer. And in the end, there's a good chance that no one will be completely happy with it."

Two such examples on TikTok have let their entire breed down, however, in a hilarious video that has already been viewed over 918,000 times.
In the video posted by Alex Centrella, two Dobermans can be seen running away from a tiny puppy. The small puppy chases the visibly scared Dobermans around a lounge, while they try to escape it by jumping up on to the couch.
""When your parents' 100-pound Dobermans are scared of your 5-pound puppy,"" read the caption.
""Dobermans really are the biggest babies,"" commented one user.

The American Kennel Club (AKC) has described Dobermans as: ""This incomparably fearless and vigilant breed [which] stands proudly among the world's finest protection dogs.
""Dobermans are compactly built dogs' muscular, fast, and powerful standing between 24 to 28 inches at the shoulder... These elegant qualities, combined with a noble wedge-shaped head and an easy, athletic way of moving, have earned Dobermans a reputation as royalty in the canine kingdom. A well-conditioned Doberman on patrol will deter all but the most foolish intruder.""
The Doberman was bred to be the companion to their creator, Louis Doberman, who wanted a dog to protect him when he went to collect debts in the 19th century. ""The ""Tax Collector's Dog"" quickly gained an international reputation as a working dog supreme,"" said the AKC.
Dobermans need a lot of exercise and can become irritable and even aggressive if they don't. ""Careful socialization and obedience training from a young age are essential for this breed,"" says Hill's Pet Nutrition, ""Doberman pinschers respond very well to positive reinforcement. No special guard training is needed for anyone who wants a good family protector. In fact, Doberman pinscher experts often advise against special guard training, which could result in over-guarding and aggression.""
Viewers on TikTok loved the video.
""Not gonna lie if I saw a mouse running around my home I'd jump on a sofa too. I can understand their fear,"" said one user. ""My dobie is absolutely terrified of two baby kittens lol. They're such babies lol,"" commented another.

40b3c6fa-b90d-40dc-a6c0-9276cb91a30f,"Trump's closing argument to New Hampshire voters pushes misinformation suggesting Democrats would ""infiltrate"" GOP primary","Trump targets Haley in New Hampshire Trump targets Haley ahead of New Hampshire primary 03:40
Manchester, New Hampshire — Former President Donald Trump's closing message to New Hampshire voters contains falsehoods about the upcoming primary election, including a baseless claim that Democrats are planning to ""infiltrate"" the primary to support former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.
""Nikki Haley is counting on Democrats and liberals to infiltrate your Republican primary,"" Trump said to a small ballroom filled with supporters in Portsmouth Wednesday evening, before blaming New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu for the state's primary system, which allows undeclared voters — which make up 40% of the state's registered voters — to vote in either the Republican or Democratic primary on Jan. 23.
Trump repeated the same unfounded claims to a crowd of over 1,000 in Atkinson, New Hampshire, Tuesday night, and inaccurately stated that Democrats want to ""cancel out"" votes for him.
By law, undeclared residents may vote in New Hampshire's GOP primary, along with Republican voters. Registered voters may only vote in one party's primary, and the deadline to switch party registration expired in early October.
Of the state's more than 873,000 registered voters, just 3,542 voters changed their registration from Democrat to undeclared before the state's Oct. 6 deadline, and just 408 Democrats changed their registration to Republican.
The electorate in New Hampshire is more moderate than in Iowa, where Trump cruised to a decisive victory in this week's caucuses, giving Haley a lane to challenge Trump in the Granite State if she can court enough moderate or independent support.
""I think Trump is one hundred percent correct to have a concern with left-leaning people voting in the Republican primary, but I think Donald Trump will be winning New Hampshire by a significant amount,"" one Republican New Hampshire political strategist told CBS News. ""And I don't think enough people will that are left-leaning will overcome the amount of supporters you have in the state of New Hampshire.""
Trump's rhetoric in New Hampshire is the latest example of his embrace of falsehoods and mis- and disinformation surrounding voting in the U.S., as he continues to claim that the 2020 election was ""stolen"" from him.
""President Trump is absolutely correct when he says Nikki Haley is relying on liberals and Democrats to infiltrate because that's who she appeals to,"" Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung told CBS News.
The former president has also promised Granite Staters he'll help the state that he once called a ""drug-infested den"" by lowering energy costs, taking care of both New Hampshire's fishing and large veteran communities.
""You inherit the legacy of red-blooded New Hampshire patriots and you really are incredible patriots who lived by that immortal motto 'Live Free or Die,'"" Trump said in Portsmouth. ""That's pretty cool. Well, we'll get it done without the dying part, but, you know, we don't want the dying part. But if you're willing to do that, if you have to.""

The title character in the sports comedy-drama TV series told his soccer team to be goldfish because the creatures have short memories.
After losing 8-7 in 10 innings a night earlier after a wild comeback by the Dodgers, the Blue Jays refocused and forgot about the sting of that defeat.
Merrifield hit a three-run homer, Danny Jansen also went deep and Toronto won 8-1 on Wednesday in taking two of three from the NL West leaders.
""It's the 'Ted Lasso' thing about being a goldfish,"" Merrifield said. ""What happened yesterday can only affect us today negatively. We did a great job of showing up today ready to play and salvaged a road trip.""
Merrifield was 2 for 4 with a season-high-tying four RBIs, two runs scored and a strikeout. He hit .462 (6-for-12) with a home run and four RBI in the three-game series.
""I'm really proud of them. That's a huge bounce-back win,"" Blue Jays manager John Schneider said. ""Tough to win a series against a good team on the road. Did that.""
Merrifield sent an 0-2 pitch from Tony Gonsolin (5-4) over the wall in left with two outs in the fifth inning, scoring Bo Bichette and Vladimir Guerrero Jr., who both singled.
Jansen led off the sixth, blasting a line-drive to left off reliever Alex Vesia for a 6-0 lead.
Merrifield sacrificed into a double play that scored Guerrero in the second for the Blue Jays' first run. Matt Chapman hit his AL-leading 32nd double of the season in the inning. Brandon Belt had a RBI single in the third.
Toronto starter Yusei Kikuchi (8-3) allowed one run and seven hits in six innings on a season-high 103 pitches. The left-hander struck out eight and walked two.
""He's been nails. When he's in the zone, he's got great stuff,"" Merrifield said. ""He had those guys really off-balance for most of the day, staying off guys' barrels and pounding the zone, working ahead.""
Toronto's Bo Bichette added a two-run single in the eighth.
Blue Jays bench coach Don Mattingly was ejected in the fifth by home-plate umpire Ben May.
""We were kind of mentioning to Ben that some of those fastballs looked like the same height for strikes on us and they disagreed,"" Schneider said.
Gonsolin gave up five runs and seven hits in five innings. The right-hander struck out five, walked three and threw a career-high 109 pitches on a 92-degree (33 Celsius) day.
The Dodgers got their lone run on James Outman's RBI single with two outs in the sixth that made it 6-1.
Kiké Hernández went 2 for 4 a day after being traded to the Dodgers from the Boston Red Sox. The utilityman helped the Dodgers win the 2020 World Series during his time in LA before going East.

Green Bay Packers quarterback Jordan Love recalled the fateful interception that ended the team’s chances of going to the NFC Championship Game on Saturday night against the San Francisco 49ers.
On the final Packers play of the game, Love moved to his right and tried to fire the ball across his body to wide receiver Christian Watson. The duck of a throw landed in the hands of 49ers linebacker Dre Greenlaw. There were two other 49ers in the area covering Watson as well.

""Play broke down, scrambling right. Saw Christian over the middle,"" Love said. ""And tried to force one into him. Thought I could make the play. Didn’t see the back side. So, really made a great play.""
He continued later, ""I haven’t looked at it yet. Haven’t looked at any pictures, so. Looking back on it, yeah, throw it away. I don’t know if I had an opportunity to be able to run, maybe get out of bounds but, you know, force it across the middle late, which is a mortal sin and it cost us. So it’s something I’ll look at. That’s an area right there I’ll be able to look at, grow from, and get better in the future.""
Love had two interceptions – both to Greenlaw. The first one was tipped off the hands of tight end Tucker Craft.

Love was 21-of-34 with 194 passing yards and had two touchdown passes.
""I think it’ll sting for a while,"" the Packers star said. ""Watching all the games going forward, it will sting just knowing that we had an opportunity to win, and we dropped the ball on that one. It’ll sting for a while, but we’ll be able to look back on it and see some good things we did.""
Green Bay wrapped the season 9-8 and picked up a big playoff win over the Dallas Cowboys before Saturday night’s result.

Prosecutors agreed Tuesday to drop securities fraud charges against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, ending a felony case that followed him for nearly a decade following allegations Paxton solicited investors for a Texas-based tech firm without disclosing he was being paid a commission.
If convicted, Paxton faced a sentence of up to 99 years in prison. Getty Images
Key Facts
As part of a pretrial agreement, prosecutors will drop charges against Paxton if he agrees to complete 100 hours of community service and 15 hours of legal ethics classes, the Dallas Morning News reported. Paxton was charged with two counts of first-degree securities fraud and a third-degree count for not registering as an investment advisor. Dan Cogdell, Paxton’s attorney, said during a pretrial hearing Tuesday that Paxton was “happy to agree to the terms of the dismissal,” according to the Texas Tribune. Cogdell noted while Paxton would agree to the dismissal, he was not admitting to any wrongdoing or entering a plea. Paxton will also pay about $270,000 in restitution to former Republican state Rep. Byron Cook and Florida businessman Joel Hochenberg, who are listed as victims of securities fraud in the lawsuit.
Surprising Fact
Paxton faced a sentence of up to 99 years in prison if found guilty of the three felony charges.
Key Background
Paxton was indicted on securities fraud charges in 2015, months into Paxton’s first term as attorney general. Prosecutors claimed Paxton brought in $840,000 from investors into Servergy, which then allegedly compensated Paxton with shares in the company worth an estimated $100,000, according to the Dallas Morning News. The Securities and Exchange Commission also filed charges against Paxton, though those charges were dismissed by a federal judge who said federal law did not require Paxton to disclose the payment from Servergy. The case faced several delays over the last nine years, including disputes between special prosecutors over compensation and a dispute over where the trial—scheduled to begin on April 15—should take place.
What To Watch For
The Justice Department is investigating allegations of corruption against Paxton, after some of his former staffers accused the attorney general of retaliation after they claimed he took part in criminal acts. The investigation involves his relationship with the Austin-based real estate developer Nate Paul, who claimed some of his properties were being stolen. The Texas House General Investigating Committee alleges Paxton interfered in lawsuits involving Paul while also issuing legal opinions to benefit Paul. The committee also claims Paul hired a woman Paxton allegedly had an affair with in exchange for legal support and payment toward renovations to Paxton’s home. The committee’s findings resulted in an impeachment inquiry into Paxton, who was impeached by the state House and later acquitted by the Senate.

The 27-year-old New Jersey native told the media that he was asked about his identity ahead of the last round and how he puts just living his life ahead of “winning.”
“I was sitting around with my buddies this morning; I was a bit overwhelmed; I told them I wish I didn’t want to win as badly as did I or as badly as I do,” Scheffler said. “I think it would make the mornings easier,” he said in his post-game interview, Fox Sports reported.
Certainly, winning is good, he explained, but it isn’t everything.
“But I love winning. I hate losing. I really do. And when you’re here in the biggest moments when I’m sitting there with the lead on Sunday, I really, really want to win badly,” he said.
“And my buddies told me this morning, my victory was secure on the cross. And that’s a pretty special feeling to know that I’m secure for forever, and it doesn’t matter if I win this tournament or lose this tournament. My identity is secure for forever,” he added.
Masters favorite Scottie Scheffler was asked what defines him as a person. His answer? His Christian faith. ""I think that's what defines me the most is my faith.

Scheffler also insisted that God has had a plan for him all along.
“I believe that today’s plans were already laid out many years ago, and I could do nothing to mess up those plans. I have been given a gift of this talent, and I use it for God’s glory. That’s pretty much it,” he explained.
“So, when I’m out there, I try to compete to the best of my abilities,” he continued. “Like I said, I really want to win. I feel like that’s how I was designed. I’ve been that way since I was a young kid. That’s always been a part of me, and I don’t think that should be going away anytime soon. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that either.”
The man who started this year’s Masters as the world’s no. one golfer concluded, saying, “At the end of the day, like I said, my identity is secure already, and I get to come out here and compete, have fun, enjoy it; and then at the end of the day, win or lose, my identity is secure.”

bcea11b5-7f0b-40ca-8d22-630bacc8a472,"""Here Lies Love"": A dance-pop musical on the life of Imelda Marcos","In 1965, when Filipinos elected Imelda Marcos' husband, Ferdinand, president, many embraced the young couple as a hopeful new start. For years, the Marcoses' power was firmly rooted in American foreign policy – a former U.S. colony, staunchly supported as a democratic bulwark against communism in Asia.
But nearly two decades later, amid violence against political opponents and corruption (symbolized by an infamous shoe collection), Filipinos took to the streets. In 1986, the ""People Power"" revolution ousted the Marcoses, forcing them into exile in the U.S.
And that's the story being told in a new musical – a disco-pop musical, of all things – created by, of all people, singer-songwriter David Byrne, of Talking Heads.
""I read that Imelda Marcos, former first lady of the Philippines, loved going to discos,"" he said. ""She had a mirror ball installed in her New York townhouse. So I thought, maybe this is a story that can be told in that way.""
Arielle Jacobs as Imelda Marcos in ""Here Lies Love."" ""Here Lies Love""
It's taken Byrne more than 30 years, but he's finally brought it to Broadway. The musical is called ""Here Lies Love.""
""This is what she said she would like on her tombstone,"" Byrne said. ""She said repeatedly that everything she's done, she did for love.""
Spoiler alert: There are no shoe showstoppers here. Rather, it's an attempt to understand what drove Imelda Marcos, and what brought her down.
Arielle Jacobs, who plays Imelda, said, ""It's been a challenge, the dichotomy of a character that wants so much to heal the planet, and share so much love with her country, and put her country on the map, and have good intentions in the beginning, and then eventually get controlled by having too much power.""
Jose Llana and Arielle Jacobs in ""Here Lies Love."" ""Here Lies Love""
Her co-star, Jose Llana, didn't have to look far to research his role as Ferdinand Marcos. Llana was born in the Philippines during the nine-year period of violent military rule ordered by Marcos. His parents, who'd been activists in college, fled to America with their family.
Quijano asked, ""What did they say when you told them that you were going to be playing Ferdinand Marcos?""
""It was not a comfortable conversation, to say the least!"" Llana laughed. ""But you know, to tell the whole story, someone has to play him. And they wanted to make sure it was going to be telling the truth about what happened, and why we left.""
Lea Salonga plays the grieving mother of assassinated opposition leader Benigno ""Ninoy"" Aquino. She's also a producer.
Salonga draws on her own memories as a teenager in the Philippines, the day the People Power revolution ignited: ""I was having a birthday party, and we were getting the phone calls from the parents of some of the kids that were at the party: 'You have to go home, it's time for you to go home, because tanks are rolling up.'""
Salonga won a Tony Award 32 years ago for her performance in ""Miss Saigon,"" in this same theater. Llana said, ""When you won that Tony, I went straight to my parents and said, 'Look, Lea did it. I can go to New York now, too!' It's like, 'Lea's breakin' down that door for all of us.'""
""Here Lies Love"" breaks down more doors. This is the first time Salonga has played a Filipina on stage. In fact, it's the first all-Filipino company on Broadway. ""I could not, in 1991, would not have predicted that,"" she said.
""What does that mean to you?"" Quijano asked.
""It means the world.""

It's not just what audiences see on stage that's different; it's the actual stage itself. David Korins, the show's scenic designer, transformed the Broadway Theatre into a nightclub. It meant leaving seats upstairs, but ripping out premium orchestra seats, making room for audience members who choose to watch (and dance) from the floor.
""Having done over 25 Broadway shows, and seen hundreds more, there has literally never been anything like this on Broadway ever,"" said Korins. ""We surround the audience, and the audience surrounds us. Lots of action happens in and around the audience.""
The Broadway Theatre has been transformed into a disco. CBS News
Not everyone is applauding. Critics have concerns that the show sanitizes the history of the Marcos regime.
To those who object to devoting a show to a figure like Imelda Marcos, Salonga said, ""Oh, goodness gracious. Our offering is, it's happened to us, but this is what happened in the end. Basically it's a story about how a people regain the power for themselves.""
""Here Lies Love""
Llana added, ""Our show is a Trojan horse that way. You come, get part of the action, you dance, have a good time, but then you get hit with the reality of what we're really talking about, what happens when democracy crumbles and martial law is proclaimed, and rights are taken away.""
David Byrne said, ""It's not like I want to glorify her, but I want to start with, as much as possible, a clean slate. She has a history, she has a story, but I want you to start with a person and kind of try and understand what made her do the things that she did.""
Arielle Jacobs said, ""There's a catharsis, and a lot of the older Filipinos that I see in the audience are crying. Because it's giving them a space to feel the things that their families didn't want to talk about.""
The real-life story is still being written. Imelda Marcos is now 94, and back in the Philippines. Last year her son, known as ""Bongbong,"" was elected president of the Philippines.
And in May, as the U.S. seeks to counter China, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. was warmly welcomed to the White House.

991e4ce9-1851-445c-b868-a9331a19cb38,4 Strategies To Help Meet Your Organization’s DE&I Recruitment Goals,"Achuthanand Tanjore Ravi, Founder & CEO, Kula.
getty
In the wake of social movements like #MeToo and Black Lives Matter, and the birth of remote work culture post a series of lockdowns, organizations across the globe realigned their recruitment goals, with the intent to form more diverse teams. Many organizations even went on to make sweeping announcements about the same, but today, they are struggling to meet the ambitious goals they set for themselves. In the recruitment world, there continues to be a lot of chatter about factoring diversity and inclusion into recruitment practices, but no one is really addressing how to go about it.
Here are four practical strategies that recruiting leaders can adopt to build truly diverse teams in their organizations.
1. Assess Data
Taking a deep dive into what the organization’s current workforce looks like is the first touchpoint. Studying the ages, gender ratio, ethnicity, family status, disability status, etc. of the organization’s team at present can help the recruiting team understand what they’re falling short of. Using a human resources information system (HRIS), they can study a range of metrics like compensation, skill set and performance data.
By analyzing the data above, recruiters can draw inferences about areas of improvement. For instance, if the engineering team has a lot more male employees than female employees, that could be a point to remember while filtering applications for engineering roles. If the organization is composed largely of twenty-somethings, they can introduce family-friendly policies to attract more experienced employees. And so on.
2. Define Short- And Long-Term Goals
After making note of the gaps and inadequacies, it’s crucial to define what success looks like. What are the roles your organization will be hiring for? What will you be prudent about while hiring for each role? Where do you hope to be after five or 10 years?
For instance, an organization can aim to decrease wage difference by 80% in seven years, improve Hispanic community representation by 5% and so on. Setting specific, attainable goals will be crucial for forming a truly diverse team.
3. Identifying Solutions
Offering upskilling classes and certification courses for underrepresented communities can give them a leg up to better their performance, and push them further up the professional ladder. Taking feedback from minority groups from within the organization on a quarterly basis can also help recruiters understand and solve for their concerns. Running an internship program for retired persons can help bridge the age ratio.
These are a few suggestions, but recruiters can identify solutions based on the gaps their organizations are trying to fill.
4. Constant Iteration
It’s important to remember that building a truly diverse society is an ongoing process with no end in sight. There will always be room for better representation. Constantly measuring progress against aspiration can help leaders monitor the solution’s effectiveness, adjust the approach to increase impact as needed and more accurately direct the use of company resources.
Some ways to ensure you’re iterating DE&I strategies:
• Sharing results in all-hands meetings brings accountability across the org
• Holding a unique promotion timeline for diverse employees
• Setting up underrepresented employee feedback cycles
Recruitment leaders are juggling a lot; hence, adopting the above strategies can help them meet their DE&I goals and ensure their organizations truly walk the talk.

James Franey of the Daily Mail broke the news that government bureaucrats are staying at luxurious hotels frequented by Hollywood’s elite — with FEMA officials reportedly budgeted $1,000 a night for each worker. The three high-end hotels are the Fairmont Kea Lani, Four Seasons, and the Grand Wailea Astoria which are all located a “45-minute drive away from the fire-ravaged town of Lahaina,” according to the outlet.
Franey writes:
The Grand Wailea, where Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman filmed their romantic comedy, Just Go With It, has 776 rooms that start at 640 square feet. The hotel is set on 40 acres of tropical gardens and sits right on one of Maui’s most beautiful beaches, Wailea Beach. And there are FEMA 100 [sic] officials staying at the four-star Marriott Wailea Beach Resort for $531 per night, a company insider said, but where rooms currently on offer to the general public start at $749.
Kaleo, who works for the local government and requested his surname be anonymous for fear of losing his job, called the move to put government officials up in expensive hotels selfish as survivors are left sheltering inside churches.
“Shouldn’t they stay closer to the site, instead of staying across on the other side of the island?” he suggested to the Daily Mail.

Meanwhile, the Biden Administration has approved $7 million in emergency funds to assist those displaced by the wildfires to stay in hotels or condos. But according to the Daily Mail, local residents say the federal agency is not allowing volunteer organizations to pass out supplies, allowing only FEMA-approved supplies to be sent to victims.
The current death toll from the wildfires is 115, with estimates of over 800 people still missing.

01fe574f-2b8d-433f-93db-226861727924,The crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous people in California and the push for change,"SACRAMENTO -- California is home to the largest Native American population in the country with more than 160 tribes. The state ranks 5th for the country's most cases of missing and murdered Indigenous people. It's been described as an epidemic, an emergency and a crisis by California tribal leaders desperate for change.
California's Superior Court reports further that Native Americans make up the highest rate of missing and murdered people.
""Whether it's our mothers, daughter, sisters, we need them back,"" said Dustin Murray, tribal administrator for the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians. ""Without the spotlight this issue is receiving, a lot of people might just go about their day not knowing this is an issue. Our women and children and people face disproportionately wide amounts of violence of any kind. The unfortunate end is them missing or murdered. The amount of survivors from abuse, stalking, it's higher than any other demographic here.""
Murray and tribe Chairwoman Regina Cuellar were both fierce advocates for California's first legislative step to address the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous people: the state's Feather Alert System that was signed into law in 2022 and enacted in January 2023.
Murray calls the alert a success one year later.
""It means that our voices were heard first and foremost and that the state is backing a solution to this problem,"" said Murray. ""Ever since spring of last year, people know it's a problem and they are not OK with it. The amount of support we have seen pour in from outside the tribal community has been wonderful.""
California became one of just a few states to enact a Feather Alert, comparable to an Amber Alert, that allows the state police to send out notifications for people missing from tribal land. It's a hand-in-hand response between tribal leaders and state leaders to collaborate to find the missing.
Qualifications for the alert include people who have disappeared under suspicious circumstances and could be in danger.
Assemblymember James Ramos is the state's first and only Native American assemblymember. He authored the bill to expose a crisis long kept in the dark.
""It's disheartening,"" Ramos told reporters at a Feather Alert roundtable discussion. ""And it had to take a California Indian person to get elected in the state legislature for that state of California to start to shed light on this that's been going on since I was growing up on the San Manuel Indian reservation.""
The Sovereign Bodies Institute started tracking the number of missing Indigenous people in California in 2015, saying the average of known cases is about 14 a year.
That means they can assume an estimation of at least 1,700 cases since the year 1900 based on that average. They say the number of cases is expected to be exponentially higher largely due to misreporting and misclassification of Native Americans in official reports.
""I think what's more scary is the inaccuracies that we know exist in collecting this type of data. Those are the reported cases. What about the unreported cases?"" asked Murray.
Statistics from the Sovereign Bodies Institute also reveal that 84% of Indigenous women living on reservations fall victim to some type of violence. They are 10 times more likely to be murdered and they make up 40% of victims exploited in sex trafficking.
Many of these cases also have further elements of substance abuse, domestic violence and mental illness.
The work is only just beginning with the Feather Alert system.
Advocates tell CBS13 they're focusing on more state and federal change including creating a national database for missing Indigenous people.
On a more local level, Murray says advocating for funding so tribes can have their own courts and police departments is critical. It's a rare resource afforded to only a few local tribes; Shingle Springs Rancheria is one of them.
Murray says they are on a mission to uplift all tribes and all the missing so their communities can find peace and heal from the past.
""It really does touch every family and every community. I don't think there's a single tribal person in this state that it doesn't affect,"" said Murray.

(AP) — Jordan Toles returned a fourth-quarter kickoff 73 yards for the go-ahead touchdown and Morgan State defeated South Carolina State 20-17 on Saturday.

6d7887be-0020-42d5-a1bc-61769e7d50a4,Argentine judge calls for detention of four Lebanese citizens in AMIA bombing probe,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — A federal judge in Argentina has called on Interpol to detain four Lebanese citizens, so they can be questioned for their suspected role in the 1994 bombing of the AMIA Jewish community center that killed 85 people.
“Regarding these individuals, there are well-founded suspicions that they are collaborators or operational agents of the … armed wing of Hezbollah,” judge Daniel Rafecas wrote in a resolution dated June 13 that the Associated Press obtained Thursday.
Argentine prosecutors have long alleged that Iranian officials used the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah to carry out the deadly attack. Iran has long denied any involvement in the incident.
Both the United States and Argentina have designated Hezbollah as a terrorist organization.
Most of the Lebanese citizens now being sought by Rafecas have ties to the porous tri-border region that connects Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay and that the United States has long said is a hub for terrorism financing.
Rafecas has called for the detention of Hussein Mounir Mouzannar, who has a Paraguayan national ID and could be living either in Paraguay or Brazil, as well as Farouk Abdul Hay Omairi, a naturalized Brazilian citizen whose last known address was on the Brazilian side of the tri-border region.
The other two people who are sought for questioning are Ali Hussein Abdallah, a naturalized Brazilian citizen who has both Brazilian and Paraguayan passports, and Abdallah Salman, who is believed to be living in Beirut."

Yet across much of Britain, including my own home parish in Somerset, the familiar chirpy sound of house martins on a summer’s day is heard less and less frequently.
One of the biggest problems facing breeding house martins is mud – or to be specific, the lack of it. Each year, having returned from their winter residence in Africa, house martins collect soft mud to build their cup-shaped nests beneath the eaves of our homes.
Long, dry spells with little or no rain, such as the one we’ve experienced this spring, mean that the pools and puddles where the house martins usually collect this mud have dried up; without mud, the birds will not be able to raise a family.
The climate crisis doesn’t just mean warmer weather – it can also lead to long spells of drought, or conversely heavy rains, which make it hard for these little birds to find the flying insects they need to feed their chicks. Yet another example, if one were needed, of how unpredictable and extreme weather conditions are threatening one of our most familiar and best-loved birds."

Pedro Moreira Salles plunked down $13.6 million on the ninth floor unit above antique dealer Herbert Schinderman in December 2019 and began renovating in 2020.
Ever since, Schinderman, 81, has been subject to “daily pounding high-volume noise and vibration that make it impossible for [him] and his family to quietly enjoy their home,” according to a lawsuit.
The 18-story West 67th Street building steps from Central Park has been home to famous names like Noel Coward, Norman Rockwell, Fannie Hurst and Isadora Duncan.
Salles, 63, is worth $4 billion and a member of one of Brazil’s oldest banking families, according to Forbes.
The work involves a construction crew of 40 to 50 people and includes the installation of a private elevator, which Schinderman says in Manhattan Supreme Court papers the co-op should not have approved.

Schinderman, who has lived in the Upper West Side building since at least 1998, said the interminable construction has caused his “dishes to vibrate, walls to crack, pictures on the wall to become crooked, and construction debris to land on the windowsills” of his eighth-floor co-op, court papers read.
Between the noise, vibration and “what sounds like heavy objects being dropped and rolled on the floor of Salles’ apartment,” Schinderman claims he “lives in fear that his ceiling will collapse.”
He claimed the situation is so bad he’s been forced to leave his home and is seeking $1 million in damages.

Tom Holland said that he hasn't consumed alcohol in a year and a half and is the ""happiest I've ever been in my life"" as a result.
The ""Spider-Man"" star, 27, spoke candidly about his sobriety journey in a lengthy, wide-ranging interview for the latest episode of the podcast ""On Purpose With Jay Shetty,"" released on Monday.
During the conversation, Holland explained when and why he decided to make a change in his lifestyle habits.
""I didn't one day wake up and say, 'I'm giving up drinking,'"" the actor said. ""Like many Brits, I had a very, very boozy December. [It was] Christmas time, I was on vacation, I was drinking a lot, and I've always been able to drink a lot. I think I get my genes from my mom's side in that thing — I can drink. And I decided to just give [it] up for January.""
Holland said that he initially just wanted to participate in Dry January, a challenge in which people abstain from drinking alcohol during the first month of the year. But the actor realized that during that time, ""all I could think about was having a drink.""

""And it just really scared me,"" he recalled. ""I just was like, 'Wow, maybe I have a little bit of an alcohol thing.' So I sort of decided to punish myself and say, 'I'll do February as well. I'll do two months off. If I can do two months off, then I can prove to myself that I don't have a problem.'""
The Marvel star said that after two months, he was ""still really struggling"" and felt like he couldn't partake in social settings.
""I was definitely addicted to alcohol,"" he said.
Holland said that he felt like he couldn't enjoy himself at various work events without having a few beers first. He also spoke about the ""pressure"" to drink due to the culture of the rugby community.
""I was really, really struggling and I started to really worry that maybe I had an alcohol problem. So I decided that I would wait until my birthday, which is June 1,"" he said. ""I said to myself, 'If I can do six months without alcohol, then I can prove to myself that I don't have a problem.' And by the time I got to June 1, I was the happiest I've ever been in my life.""

Holland said that abstaining from alcohol for six months had significant health benefits for him.
""I could sleep better. I could handle problems better,"" he said. ""Things that would go wrong on set, that would normally set me off, I could take in my stride. I had much better mental clarity. I felt healthier, I felt fitter. I just sort of said to myself, like, 'Why? Why am I enslaved to this drink? Why am I so obsessed [with] the idea of having this drink?'""
Holland said that he previously had periods of not drinking alcohol. But this time around, to make a lasting change, he focused on adjusting his mindset and owning up to the reality that he drank to ""feel more comfortable in a social environment.""
""It's honestly been the best thing I've ever done,"" Holland said of the decision to become sober. ""I'm a year and a half into it now. It doesn't even cross my mind. I've found amazing replacements that I think are fantastic, ones that are also really healthy.""
The ""Crowded Room"" star added that his friends have been supportive of his sobriety, and his mom followed suit in his journey. He's also realized that he enjoys being the designated driver.
""I love being that person that makes sure that everyone gets home,"" Holland said. ""I like being a dependable person.""
""I'm over the moon to be sober,"" he said. ""I love it."""

SAN JOSE — The former director of sports medicine at San Jose University was sentenced to 24 months in prison for sexually abusing female student-athletes, the Department of Justice said.
As sports director, Scott Shaw was responsible for treating athletes' injuries. However, the DOJ said he used his position to inappropriately touch female student-athletes.
He was charged in 2022 with violating the civil rights of four students who played on women's athletics teams by touching their breasts and buttocks without their consent and without a legitimate purpose. He eventually pleaded guilty to two counts of deprivation of rights under color of law.
He will also be under a year of supervised release after his prison sentence is served and was orderd to pay a $15,000 fine. The DOJ said Shaw was ordered to surrender on or before March 6, 2024.
Shaw served as director of sports medicine and head athletic trainer from 2008 to 2020. In 2021, then-President of San Jose State University Mary Papazian apologized to the victims.
Papazian, who joined the school in 2016, eventually resigned over claims the complaints of 15 former female student-athletes were mishandled."

The Polk County Sheriff’s Office said 27-year-old Tyler Mountain of Lake Whales, Florida was arrested and charged with lewd exhibition and lewd exhibition to an elderly person, for incidents stemming back to July and October.
Detectives launched an investigation on Oct. 26, 2023, after a 76-year-old woman told the sheriff’s office that an employee of a local pest control and lawn services company exposed himself to her while he was inside her home.

But when he stepped out of her bathroom, she told investigators, Mountain allegedly had his privates out and asked for help because his zipper was broken. The woman refused.
Detectives reached out to the company Mountain worked for and were told by a regional manager that Mountain’s employment had been terminated after learning of the complaint.

When she returned, a detective met with the victim and learned Mountain was at her home on July 24, 2023, to perform lawn maintenance. While there, he allegedly exposed himself and, like the other incident, claimed his zipper was broken.

As the season reaches the final few games, nominations and awards have come into focus. So it's the ideal time to shine some light on Motherwell’s star players of the campaign.
The name Kevin Van Veen is enough to make Motherwell fans giddy. With 25 goals under his belt he should absolutely be on the shortlist for Premiership player of the year.
Van Veen has saved Motherwell from relegation and his goals have a degree of skill and sheer class that even neutral fans can't fail to be impressed by.
The Dutch striker has given his all to this club and should be rewarded before he inevitably leaves. He the most in-form striker in the league currently and if he isn't nominated then something is seriously wrong.
Calum Butcher has transformed our defence since his arrival in February. The man is a brick wall with legs.
We have lacked a defender that isn’t afraid to wipe out a few ankles when needed and he’s stepped into the role beautifully. He is a natural leader among the squad and the partnership he’s formed with Dan Casey has been thrilling to watch.
The final player I want to highlight is Max Johnston. As one of the younger squad members there wasn’t a large expectation placed upon him by fans other than hoping the managers would give him adequate game-time.
However, in becoming a regular starter he has developed massively and matured a lot, as well as morphing into a spectacular goalscorer.
It has been a far from perfect season for Motherwell but the players deserve praise for being able to pull themselves out of the slump we were in and hopefully Van Veen can smash his 30-goal target before the campaign ends."

Timbaland has apologized after facing a backlash for saying that Justin Timberlake should “put a muzzle” on Britney Spears.
Last month the singer released her tell-all memoir, ”The Woman in Me,” which details her rise to pop superstardom and the challenges she has endured in the spotlight.

The book also reflects on her relationship with the *NSYNC star, and includes an account of an abortion she had 20 years ago while they were together.
Opening up about Timberlake's 2002 hit “Cry Me A River,” Spears writes that the song made her out to be unfaithful and a “harlot who’d broken the heart of America’s golden boy”.
Timbaland was asked about the renewed interest in the song, which he produced, during an interview with producer 9th Wonder at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC last month.

“She’s going crazy, right?” he said. “I wanted to call JT, ‘Man, you gotta put a muzzle on that girl.’”
He’s since apologized after facing widespread criticism.
“I apologize to the Britney fans and her,” he said while live on TikTok, reading a comment about his attitudes towards women. “Yes, ‘you know about respecting women?’ Hell yeah.”

In her book, Spears also opens up about the physical and emotional pain she went after her abortion.
“I’m sure people will hate me for this, but I agreed not to have the baby,” the “Gimme More” singer writes. “I don’t know if that was the right decision. If it had been left up to me alone, I never would have done it.”

Spears recalls having the abortion at home to avoid their family or the media finding out. “To this day, it’s one of the most agonizing things I have ever experienced in my life.”
She also discusses the fallout of their breakup, which she claimed the *NSYNC singer initiated over text message.
Spears and Timberlake began dating in 1999 when she was 17 and he was 18. They first met as children on the The All New Mickey Mouse Club."

b1af9045-7252-4f9d-ba49-a7477568bcc3,"The Big Three Are Downgrading Banks, But Are They In Bad Shape?","On August 7, Moody’s Investors Service (MCO) kickstarted a cascade of bank rating actions, downgrading 10 banks or bank holding companies (BHCs), placing six more under review and putting negative outlooks on another 11.
On August 15, Fitch Ratings, smallest of the Big Three NRSROs, told the market it wasn’t kidding when it lowered the U.S. banking industry’s operating environment score in late June and subsequently downgraded the U.S. long-term sovereign rating August 1. If rate hikes continued, Fitch cautioned that it might “be forced to” review over 70 banks and downgrade dozens. Shares in JPMorgan, Bank of America BAC and Citigroup C fell after the Fitch announcement. On August 21, one week later, S&P (SPGI) downgraded five mid-sized banks. Bank share prices dropped again.
The credit story here is obvious. Banks make money on the spread between their loan products and their cost of funds. The Fed has been aggressively raising funding costs: from 0.08% at the pandemic peak, in 2021, to 2.33% in August 2022, to 5.33% now, and it will go on rising if inflation persists. Just as Americans are having to pay more for goods, services and loans, so too are U.S. banks having to manage through lower demand, shrinking margins, evaporating liquidity, decreasing capital quality and real estate asset devaluations. Under the circumstances, bank downgrades would seem natural or inevitable.
But in an August 21 editorial, the American Bankers Association, the U.S. bank lobby, claimed the rating agencies missed the mark. My firm, Credit Spectrum Corp., arrived at a similar conclusion completely independently, after scrutinizing our proprietary bank health index, which we update quarterly using data on bank capital, liquidity, asset quality and earnings as reported to the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC).
By comparing index readings taken at Q1 2021 (before rates rose) to those at Q1 2023 (post-meltdown) we found 80% of the downgraded banks are actually stronger credits now than in 2021. Among Moody’s 10 downgrades, only Amarillo National Bank’s score did not improve. Old National Bancorp (ONB) of Evansville, IN ($48.2BN in assets) and Pinnacle Financial Partners (PNFP) of Nashville, TN ($46.7BN) improved 48% and 28%, respectively. Three banks downgraded by S&P improved by an average margin of 14%, but only one, UMB Financial (UMBF) of Kansas City, MO ($208 BN), outperformed its cohort ($50 - $250BN in assets).
Undoubtedly some U.S. banks are struggling now, but they are not necessarily the ones recently downgraded. That is distinctly odd. What is also odd is that Moody’s and S&P only downgraded 15 of 5000 banks, and only one, Associated Banc-Corp (ASB) was on both of their lists.
It’s a fiction that NRSROs exist purely to deliver neutral, objective credit information to the market. Like any American media company, licensed credit rating agencies have long enjoyed First Amendment protection. But, they are unlike any other media company. NRSRO revenues come mainly from transaction fees, not subscriptions or advertising. Their real economic function is to produce benchmarks for pricing and repricing debt capital. Commercially, they fulfill many (but not all) of the functions of exchanges. They also compete against each other much in the manner of exchanges. At the same time, financial regulators may see their primary function as filling a quasi-regulatory role for financial markets.
These insights may shed light on some hidden drivers of rating actions.
Some rated markets (like sovereigns and banks) are deeply intertwined. When the economy is volatile, the correlations complicate an NRSRO’s job. It may resist making a (technically warranted) downgrade if the harm outweighs the benefit. Quite possibly, Moody’s Aaa rating on the U.S. constrains its freedom of rating actions on U.S. banks (or vice versa) in ways that are not obvious to the public.
The opposite logic can also apply. NRSROs are oligopolists whose credit information products are designed to capture market share or exploit their dominance in niches. Financial institution (FI) ratings are dominated by the Big Three. Since 2019, S&P, the largest NRSRO, has the largest market share for FI ratings: 37-38%. That is 5x more than fourth-largest, DBRS Morningstar’s share. Whereas, second- and third-largest, Moody’s and Fitch, have been tied at around 23% for years.
The leaves are from trees found in a hedgerow, shot individually and composited together. getty
Recently Moody’s edged ahead of Fitch, which may explain why the latter threatened to downgrade more than 70 banks (without actually downgrading any) and specifically, almost vindictively called out JPMorgan, whose CEO had termed the Fitch sovereign downgrade “ridiculous.” Fitch did not mention Bank of America (BAC), Citi (C) or Wells Fargo (WFC).
Finally, NRSRO downgrades may be useful to certain regulatory interests seeking to accelerate the rate of bank consolidation. As Senator Elizabeth Warren recently pointed out in a speech to the U.S. Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee’s Subcommittee on Economic Policy, U.S. banks shrank from 18,000 to just 5,000 since 1990—a compound average disappearance rate of 1.7% a year over 33 years. She has urged regulators to halt the rubber-stamping of large bank acquisitions of small banks based on communitarian arguments for small banks and against scale. What appears missing in these discussions is the availability of objective, comprehensive, unbiased analysis of how banks of all sizes are actually performing."

""I know what's your phone number — 9-1-1,"" the boy says to the deputy.
After hugging the boy, Pracht explained that 911 is for those who are in trouble and need help. ""It's very important,"" he tells the boy. ""You need to be careful when you call that number, okay?""
""Only in emergencies. And if you're hurt, or someone else is hurt, your mom needs help. You know, someone is doing something they're not supposed to do. Give us a call, okay?""
The boy apologized, and Pracht told him not to worry about it.
The sheriff's office posted the video on Facebook on Thursday, where it was viewed nearly 10,000 times. ""Omg, you can't be mad, he called to give you a hug,"" one commenter wrote.
""He was very sweet and Deputy Pracht is more than happy to give a hug! A valuable lesson learned and a sweet moment shared,"" the sheriff's office replied.
In a statement, Hillsborough Sheriff Chad Chronister said they ""deeply appreciate the genuine kindness shown by this young child.""
""Our deputies are more than willing to share a hug and spread love to children in our community. However, it's essential for everyone to remember that 911 is a lifeline for emergencies,"" he said. ""We are here to help, and we encourage parents and educators to teach children about the appropriate use of emergency services.""
CBS News has reached out to the boy's mother for further information and is awaiting response."

getty
Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have emerged as a popular mechanism for funding and developing infrastructure projects around the world. In recent years, these partnerships have extended beyond traditional transportation and utility projects to encompass social infrastructure. This trend reflects the growing recognition that social infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and community centers, play a critical role in promoting economic development and improving quality of life. By leveraging the resources of both the public and private sectors, PPPs can help to optimize the provision of social infrastructure while reducing the burden on public budgets.
During my time as the CEO of a public-private partnership (P3) development firm and national policy advisor on P3s, I’ve seen firsthand how public-private partnerships can help improve social infrastructure, but I’ve also seen instances where it may not be the best solution.
PPPs involve the collaboration between the public and private sectors to build and operate infrastructure projects. The public sector retains ownership and control of the assets, while the private sector provides financing, construction and/or management services. PPPs can be structured in a variety of ways, including build-operate-transfer (BOT), build-own-operate (BOO) and design-build-finance-operate (DBFO). In any case, the partnerships are typically established through a competitive bidding process to ensure accountability and the best value for taxpayers.
One of the most significant benefits of PPPs is the ability to access additional sources of funding. Traditional financing mechanisms, such as municipal bonds, can be limited by public borrowing constraints and credit ratings. PPPs, however, offer the opportunity to tap into private capital, which can provide additional resources and accelerate development timelines. This can be especially important in the case of social infrastructure, where the need for investment may be great, but public financing may be constrained.
Beyond funding, PPPs also offer access to private sector expertise and efficiency. Private firms have extensive experience in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of infrastructure projects, which can translate into more robust solutions and lower costs. Additionally, private partners are often incentivized to manage projects effectively and efficiently to maximize financial returns, which can lead to better service for users.
Several successful examples of social infrastructure PPPs exist across the globe. In the United Kingdom, for example, the Private Finance Initiative has been used for more than 25 years to deliver social infrastructure projects, ranging from schools and hospitals to community centers and libraries. Similarly, Canada’s Brampton Civic Hospital was developed through a PPP, which delivered the project on time and within budget while retaining long-term public ownership.
Despite their potential benefits, PPPs may not always be a good fit. One key factor to consider is the complexity of the project or service being provided. If it is a simple or standard service, the benefits of partnering with the private sector may not outweigh the risks. Another factor is the level of public scrutiny or controversy surrounding the project. High-profile, controversial projects may be better managed within the public sector in order to maintain public trust and ensure transparency. Furthermore, a government must consider the overall level of risk it is willing to take on, as PPPs can be more expensive in the long run due to private sector profit margins and may also require a higher level of financial expertise and resources on the part of the government. Ultimately, governments must weigh the potential benefits against the risks and determine whether or not a PPP is the best option for each individual project or service.
When entering into public-private partnership arrangements, private companies must conduct thorough due diligence on the PPP project. Due diligence helps private companies identify the risks associated with the project and to determine whether it is feasible and financially viable. The due diligence process should also assess the strengths and weaknesses of the public sector partner, the project’s legal and regulatory environment, and the potential social and environmental impact of the project.
Secondly, private companies must establish effective communication strategies with their public sector partners. Communication is critical for building and maintaining trust between the private and public sectors. Private companies must ensure that all stakeholders, including local communities and interest groups, are consulted and engaged throughout the project’s life cycle. Effective communication channels can help to prevent misunderstandings, disputes and delays.
In conclusion, I believe expanding the use of PPPs in social infrastructure development is a promising approach for meeting growing infrastructure needs around the world. By leveraging private sector financing, expertise and efficiency, PPPs can offer an effective mechanism for delivering critical infrastructure while reducing the burden on the government. However, careful consideration of risks and challenges is necessary to ensure that PPPs are structured in a transparent and accountable manner that maximizes outcomes for all stakeholders. As such, continued research and analysis on best practices for PPPs in social infrastructure development are essential.

Officers spotted a vehicle on the Southwest Freeway that was allegedly stolen in a carjacking incident, according to Houston Police Department (HPD). The suspect allegedly attempted to flee, causing officers to pursue the vehicle. A car chase began on the highway and ended once the suspect allegedly crashed into other vehicles, police said.
The suspect got out of the vehicle and allegedly shot one of the officers, according to police. He allegedly attempted to carjack two more vehicles at the scene.
The suspect allegedly shot the 20-year-old police officer in the leg, according to HPD Chief Troy Finner. He was taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital and is expected to make a full recovery. The suspect was also shot and died at the hospital, per police. (RELATED: Milwaukee Police Officer And Suspect Shot And Killed In Confrontation).
The officer was shot following a brief vehicle pursuit at 59 and Chimney Rock. The suspect has also been shot and is an unknown condition. More information will follow. Avoid the area of 59 and Chimney Rock. #hounews — Houston Police (@houstonpolice) November 11, 2023
Finner credited a good Samaritan who pulled the injured officer to safety in the press briefing. John Lally, the samaritan, was wearing a body camera that captured the incident, according to ABC 13. The video captures the sound of bullets flying as Lally drags the officer across the ground, placing him behind a truck.
“I just kinda ran over there, and I grabbed that guy with the other police officer. Me and him, together, we grabbed him by his vest so he wouldn’t get shot again,” Lally told the outlet. He said he felt he was in the right place at the right time.
He stayed with the officer until paramedics arrived, the outlet noted.
Lally can be heard comforting the officer in the video. “It’s just your leg. It’s just your leg. You hear me? Just squeeze my hand as tight as you have to. Do you know what I’m saying? Don’t worry. I’m here with you.”
“[Lally] has had trouble with law enforcement in his life, but today, he and a few other citizens, along with our officers, when that officer went down, they pulled him to safety,” Chief Finner said in the press conference. “I want to celebrate that.”
The injured officer was put on administrative leave, per department policy, according to the news conference."

It makes sense to choose a safe investment option right now to shield you from losses and help your money grow. Getty Images
High inflation and increasing rates are significantly impacting your financial health. The recent uptick in interest rates translates to steeper credit card payments and higher loan and mortgage rates, making it harder for many potential buyers to purchase a home. On the other hand, these elevated rates are boosting yields on deposit accounts, enabling you to earn more from your money.
Still, not all investments are keeping up with inflation, so it's essential to choose your investments strategically. Amid the uncertainty in the economy, it makes sense to choose low-risk investment options that not only shield you from potential losses but also enable your money to grow.
The best investments right now
Here are the top investments in the current market that have a low-risk profile while still offering the potential to grow your savings.
High-yield savings accounts
A high-yield savings account (HYSA) is an account that pays annual percentage yields (APYs) of up to 10 times higher than a traditional savings account. As of July 2023, the average APY on traditional savings accounts was 0.42%, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). By contrast, some high-yield savings accounts — especially those found at online banks — offer yields ranging from 4.75% to 5.05% right now.
High-yield savings accounts are a low-risk place to stash and grow your money. While an HYSA might not yield returns as high as other types of investments, this type of account offers the flexibility of withdrawing your money anytime without being tied to a term.
Get started by comparing some of the top high-yield savings options available now.
Certificates of deposit (CDs)
Certificates of deposit (CDs) are a type of deposit account offered by banks and credit unions that offer a fixed return. With a CD, you agree to deposit a certain amount of money for a fixed period, usually ranging from a few months to five years or up to 10 years in some cases.
In exchange for the longer savings commitment, your bank offers a fixed interest rate typically higher than a regular savings account. CDs are generally considered a safe investment because they are FDIC-insured up to the legal limit ($250,000 per account, per insured bank), which protects your money in case your bank fails.
Keep in mind, though, that if you need to withdraw money from your CD before its maturity date, you could incur an early withdrawal penalty or miss out on potential earnings. However, some CDs, like no-penalty CDs, allow you to withdraw funds before the maturity date, albeit at a lower interest rate than traditional CDs.
If you have a financial goal, you can align a CD's maturity date with when you need your money. For example, if you plan to make a down payment on a house in two years, you might opt for a two-year CD to keep your money safe while earning a higher interest rate.
Get started now with Discover and lock in your terms from 3 months to 10 years.
Money market accounts
If you anticipate needing the funds and would rather not lock them in a CD, a money market account (MMA) may be worth a look. This type of deposit account is unique because it combines the benefits of a savings and a checking account. Money market accounts are also low-risk and typically offer higher interest rates than regular savings accounts, which makes them an attractive option in the current economy.
MMAs often require a higher minimum balance to earn the stated interest rate or to avoid monthly fees, however.
Walter Russell, president of the financial advisory firm Russell & Associates, advises that due diligence should be done before opening a high-yield savings account, CD or money market account.
""I recommend researching several banks and institutions,"" says Russell. ""Earlier this year, we had some issues with several regional banks. When those couple of banks went under, this should have forced investors to do more investigating into what banks do with their deposits.""
As with other deposit accounts, money market accounts have FDIC or NCUA insurance up to $250,000, which is sufficient for most investors.

U.S. government bonds
U.S. government bonds are debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury. When you purchase bonds, you're essentially lending money to the government. In return, you'll receive regular interest payments until the bond matures, at which point your principal is returned.
Bonds are usually issued in $1,000 increments and have varying maturity dates, typically from one to 30 years. They're generally considered safe investments, as they're backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Consider investing in bonds if you're looking for a low-risk investment that produces steady income or want to balance out the volatility in your portfolio.
The bottom line
In today's uncertain economy, it's worth considering low-risk investments that still have the potential to grow your money. Whether you decide to invest in one of the above vehicles or other asset classes, consider how such an investment aligns with your overall financial plan.
""Don't get lost chasing individual investment returns,"" says Brandon Renfro, a certified financial planner and owner of Belonging Wealth Management in Longview, Texas. ""Identify a target portfolio allocation that is appropriate for your goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance, and then think about your investments in regard to how they fit into your portfolio. If you need to include more stable investments in that mix, then high-yield savings accounts, CDs, or money market accounts could all have a place."""

5cb14165-b32c-4977-9697-c3dc096a2e55,Jamie Anderson On The Anime Origins Of ‘Terrahawks’ And Japan’s Love Of ‘Thunderbirds’,"'Terrahawks' was a very popular show back in the 80s, but actually started out as an anime. Anderson Entertainment
Following some interesting comments made by Jamie Anderson last Summer about the anime origins of Terrahawks, I decided to follow up and find out more.
Jamie Anderson is a producer and the son of the late Gerry Anderson, who created classics such as Thunderbirds. During the 80s though, Terrahawks was the main attraction and something I grew up watching.
However, its origins are rather interesting, as the series began as an anime, something that Jamie was happy to expand upon.
“Dad was a prolific creative, even through the tougher periods in his career. After the highs of the 1960s and 1970s under entertainment mogul Lew Grade, by the early 1980s, his career and life had taken a turn for the worse. He was without work, separated from his wife, and struggling for money. Through this period he was developing ideas; some new, others related to his previous shows. As far as I recall, one of these ideas was Thunderhawks. You can see how this was a halfway house between Thunderbirds and Terrahawks. Thunderhawks was pitched to backers in Japan to be produced as an anime series, I believe it was Tohokushinsha, but they felt the premise was so strong it should be a live-action show. The funding wasn’t there for that approach and so the project collapsed. The pitch was too impressive for its own good! It was then a short while later when Dad met Christopher Burr who eventually found a way to fund the show as a puppet series and the rest is history.”

There is also an fascinating follow on to this, as the pitch Jamie mentions had amazing artwork by none other than Yoshikazu Yasuhiko (shown above). There’s also a nice gallery of the other designs here in case you are curious.
Especially as the spherical Zeroids seemed to also have an earlier anime equivalent, although whether this followed into Terrahawks directly is unclear.
It’s also worth pointing out that the Japanese version of Terrahawks also had an additional anime opening, which is also pretty gorgeous in terms of its animation (shown below).
One of the other Gerry Anderson anime related projects was that of Thunderbirds 2086, which was known as Techno Voyager in Japan, although Jamie has a tougher time remembering this one.
“Thunderbirds 2086 was barely on the edge of my awareness as a kid. As I understand it, the original Thunderbirds IP was licensed from ITC (the company that owned Thunderbirds at the time) to be produced as an anime adaptation. Not a reboot or a continuation of the classic Thunderbirds, but something very different and new. Dad wasn’t involved with, or connected to, the show at all as far as I am aware. I’m not sure he was even asked, although it’s possible.”
There is also another interesting facet that pre-dated Thunderbirds 2086, that of the anime Zero Tester. Directed by the legendary Ryosuke Takahashi with designwork from Studio Nue, it was in many ways heavily inspired by Thunderbirds.
Thunderbirds also has a fascinating legacy with anime creators in Japan, something that Jamie thought had a lot to do with its technical detail and mechanical fascination.
The 'Terrahawks' anime had some interesting and very different ideas for the vehicles. MBS
“I think the technical detail, model work, mechanical fascination and positive spirit in the original Thunderbirds all speak to a Japanese audience. When Thunderbirds first arrived as an import in the 1960s, I think it must have struck a chord with that audience. It was something new, innovative and very exciting. The design work and aesthetic of the vehicles, the look and feel of the puppets, and the overall on-screen effect connected with audiences at just the right time. Since then there seems to have been a handing-down of the show between generations, as well as a continued fascination with the timeless elements and retro-futuristic style.”
Thunderbirds has certainly had a noticeable impact on various mecha designers I have interviewed over the years. From Kimitoshi Yamane to Yutaka Izubuchi and even Shoji Kawamori. The latter also designed the new Thunderbird S fighter for Thunderbirds Are Go (shown below). Something Jamie explained in more detail.
“We didn’t have any direct involvement with ITV’s 2015 reboot Thunderbirds Are Go. But as far as I know, the execs on the show wanted a vehicle for Kayo (previously called Tin-Tin) and felt that Kawamori’s amazing creativity and design work would be a perfect match for the new series, with a design sensibility that would be respectful of the classic Thunderbirds while bringing the design firmly into the 21st Century. They were right, and the Thunderbird S looked very cool as a result.”

Finishing up, I wanted to know if Jamie had any plans for making any anime and it seems that’s something that could be on the cards.
“A few conversations have happened over the last few years. I think there’s a great potential for an Anderson anime series that speaks to the sensibilities of Anderson shows of the past while making them appealing to a modern Japanese (and global) audience. There are so many potential classic Anderson IPs, and new ones, those created by Dad but never produced, and many more that we have created in the last 10 years. We’re always open to collaborating with Japanese studios and producers. So we’d be happy to hear from anyone on the Anderson anime front.
“We’re always looking for ways to connect directly with the fantastic and dedicated Japanese audience. We’re currently doing a new range of collectibles, die-cast Eagles and Thunderbird 2, which will be available to fans in Japan via Bellfine. We’re also looking at publishers to partner with for some of our other releases like the Space: 1999 Moonbase Alpha Technical Manual, comic anthologies and more. There are lots of big plans, and I’m looking forward to expanding the Anderson legacy in Japan in the coming years.”
Terrahawks is available to buy on Blu-ray via Amazon. You can also find a nice primer on the series here, if you are at all curious.

35627758-af97-4ff3-96e8-b49e23b24f7e,DNR warns at least 4 inches of ice needed before going out on lakes,"ST. PAUL, Minn. — As temperatures drop, ice conditions are constantly changing across lakes and ponds in Minnesota and western Wisconsin.
On Friday morning, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources addressed the thin ice concerns at Como Lake in St. Paul.
Some people were out fishing on the lake, which had about 3 to 3 1/2 inches of ice in most spots. The DNR recommends there be at least 4 inches of ice when going out on a lake.
Clear ice is the safest on a lake, and 5 to 7 inches of ice is needed for snowmobiles and small ATVs. The DNR added that 7 to 8 inches is needed for side-by-sides, and 9 to 10 inches is necessary for a small vehicle or SUV to go out on the ice.

""Ice conditions can change from day to day, especially in windy conditions,"" said DNR Concervation Officer Matt Paavola. ""We recommend checking with local experts if it's a lake or area you haven't ventured out on before.""
Paavola recommended wearing a life jacket and carrying tools like ice picks when venturing out onto a frozen lake.
The DNR says the lack of snow in the early winter season helps ice form, because snow acts as an insulator that can keep ice from forming. Ice conditions are never completely safe, and can vary quite a bit.
The DNR has a list of ice thickness guidelines, which you can see here."
e8e0f353-e89a-41f4-9ba7-1c2843c5a37b,NBC News cuts ties with former RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel,"NBC News has reversed its decision to hire former Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel as a political analyst after network executives faced a chorus of fierce on-air criticism.
“There is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group. After listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,” NBCUniversal Group Chairman Cesar Conde said in an email to staff members Tuesday.
“I want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down. While this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it,” Conde wrote.
The decision to cut ties with McDaniel comes less than a week after NBC News announced her hiring, prompting an extraordinary public protest from the former host of its flagship Sunday morning political show, as well as from many of the most popular hosts of the network’s cable channel.
Rachel Maddow opened her show on MSNBC on Monday night by urging NBC News to change its mind about hiring McDaniel.
“I find the decision to put her on the payroll inexplicable, and I hope they will reconsider that decision,” Maddow said.
MSNBC and NBC News are both part of the NBCUniversal News Group.
McDaniel did not immediately respond to a voicemail and emails requesting comment.
McDaniel’s hiring came two weeks after she left her post as head of the RNC, where she had voiced support for baseless claims by former President Donald Trump about the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.
In Conde’s memo, he said the decision to bring McDaniel on board was made “because of our deep commitment to presenting our audiences with a widely diverse set of viewpoints and experiences, particularly during these consequential times. We continue to be committed to the principle that we must have diverse viewpoints on our programs, and to that end, we will redouble our efforts to seek voices that represent different parts of the political spectrum.”
The on-air journalists at NBC News and MSNBC argued that McDaniel lacked credibility after The Detroit News reported she joined Trump on a phone call as he reportedly pressured Republican canvassers in her home state of Michigan not to certify the 2020 presidential election results.
In an interview Sunday on NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” which host Kristen Welker said had been scheduled before it was announced that McDaniel was going to become a paid contributor, McDaniel addressed the phone call with the canvassers, saying, “​​I was not telling them to do anything.”
“The pressure was being put on them from the hours and hours of threats and abuse they were receiving that coerced them to change their vote,” McDaniel said Sunday, adding that she told them, “I support you voting your conscience.”
Following her appearance, NBC News chief political analyst Chuck Todd said on the broadcast that “she has credibility issues that she still has to deal with.”
The criticism over her hiring continued Monday from early in the morning to late at night on MSNBC, with “Morning Joe” co-host Mika Brzezinski saying that while NBC News should include conservative Republican voices to balance election coverage, it shouldn’t be someone “who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier.”
Television networks frequently add politicians and political operatives to their rosters to serve as analysts and commentators: MSNBC host Jen Psaki was a former press secretary to President Joe Biden, and Michael Steele, who served as chairman of the RNC from 2009 to 2011, is an MSNBC political analyst and co-host.
But the hiring of McDaniel immediately prompted internal concern.
Nicolle Wallace, a former White House communications director for President George W. Bush who is now a host on MSNBC, said on her show Monday that having McDaniel on the network would embolden “election deniers.”
“NBC News, either wittingly or unwittingly, is teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,” she said."
9a7bfe93-8bcc-4eab-bc34-319a39712092,Texas On The Verge Of Allowing Chaplains In Public Schools,"A bill allowing chaplains in schools passed the Texas Legislature Tuesday evening after the state’s House of Representatives voted largely along party lines, according to Religion News Service.
House Bill 3614 was introduced by Republican state Rep. Cole Hefner in March and if signed into law would allow schools to “employ or accept as volunteers chaplains,” according to the text of the bill. The bill passed the state Senate earlier this month before passing the state House after a 89-58 vote, according to Religion News Service. (RELATED: Archdiocese Says ‘God Is Trans’ Exhibit In New York Church Removed After Launching Investigation)
If signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, the bill will go into effect on Sept. 1 for the 2023-2024 school year, according to the bill’s text, and gives chaplains the ability to act as a mental health resource, aid in suicide prevention and restorative justice practices, according to the bill’s text. It would also allow chaplains to work with schools without obtaining certification from the State Board of Education.
The bill is part of a larger campaign by the National School Chaplain Association (NSCA), which aims to place more chaplains in schools to help work with students and teachers on issues such as depression, suicidality and “spiritual care,” according to the organization’s website. Some Democratic state legislators expressed concerns that the bills would “lead to Christian nationalists infiltrating our public schools” and tried to amend the bill to ban chaplains from proselytizing and obtain parental consent before speaking with a student, but the measures failed, according to the Religion News Service.
Rocky Malloy, chief executive officer of NSCA, testified on behalf of the bill, arguing it would make schools a safer place and dispelled the argument that chaplains in schools would be a violation of church and state, according to Religion News Service.
“Chaplains operate within an individual’s belief and convictions — they are not working to convert people to religion,” Malloy said.
Hefner, Middleton, Abbott and NSCA did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Actor Rainn Wilson opened up about feeling unfulfilled while filming some seasons of the hit show ""The Office,"" in which he played the chaotic character Dwight Schrute.
As he promotes his newly released book, ""Soul Boom: Why We Need a Spiritual Revolution,"" Wilson has been frank about some of the highlights of his career, specifically in how the grass always looks greener elsewhere.
""When I was in 'The Office,' I spent several years really mostly unhappy because it wasn't enough,"" Wilson said on Bill Maher's ""Club Random"" podcast. ""I was making hundreds of thousands. I wanted millions, and I was a TV star, but I wanted to be a movie star. It was never enough.""
The podcast episode has not yet been released, but a transcript was provided to OutKick, which first reported on the interview.
Wilson reflected that he was working with A-list actors but still felt unfulfilled, even when the show was incredibly successful. To combat that, he took ""a really deep dive into spirituality,"" which is the topic of his latest book, according to TODAY.
""I'm on a hit show, Emmy nominated every year, making lots of money working with, like, Steve Carell and Jenna Fisher and John Krasinski and these amazing writers and incredible directors like Paul Feig,"" he said. ""I'm on one of the great TV shows. People love it. I wasn't enjoying it.""
""I was thinking about, 'Why am I not a movie star? Why am I not the next Jack Black or the next Will Ferrell?"" he added. ""How come I can't have a movie career? Why don't I have this development deal?'""
The actor also said he only signed on for the hit show in order to buy a house, but he acknowledges he became a part of something much bigger.
""I wasn't thinking about giving laughter as a therapeutic remedy and a balm and a salve to a hurting populace,"" Wilson said on the podcast, per OutKick. ""What an honor it was to be a part of something like that."""

Keith announced in June 2022 that he'd been undergoing treatment for stomach cancer since the previous fall.
The multi-platinum-selling singer-songwriter tweeted at the time that he'd had surgery and chemotherapy and radiation in the prior six months.
""So far, so good,"" the Oklahoma native said. ""I need time to breathe, recover and relax.
""I am looking forward to spending this time with my family. But I will see the fans sooner than later. I can't wait.""

Unabashed patriot
Sometimes a polarizing figure in country music, the 6-foot-4 Keith broke out in the country boom years of the 1990s, crafting an identity around his macho, pro-American swagger and writing songs that fans loved to hear. During the course of his career, he publicly clashed with other celebrities and journalists and often pushed back against record executives who wanted to smooth his rough edges.
He was known for his overt patriotism on post 9/11 songs like ""Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue,"" and boisterous barroom tunes like ""I Love This Bar"" and ""Red Solo Cup."" He had a powerful booming voice, a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor and a range that carried love songs as well as drinking songs.
Among his 20 No. 1 Billboard hits were ""How Do You Like Me Now?!,"" ""Should've Been a Cowboy,"" ""As Good As I Once Was,"" ""My List"" and ""Beer for My Horses,"" a duet with Willie Nelson.
Long road to stardom
Keith worked as a roughneck in the oil fields of Oklahoma as a young man, then played semi-pro football before launching his career as a singer.
""I write about life, and I sing about life, and I don't overanalyze things,"" Keith told The Associated Press in 2001, following the success of his song ""I'm Just Talking About Tonight.""
Keith learned good lessons in the booming oil fields, which toughened him up, but also showed him the value of money.
""The money to be made was unbelievable,"" Keith told The Associated Press in 1996. ""I came out of high school in 1980 and they gave me this job December of 1979, $50,000 a year. I was 18-years-old.""
But the domestic oil field industry collapsed and Keith had not saved. ""It about broke us,"" he said. ""So I just learned. I've taken care of my money this time.""
He spent a couple of seasons as a defensive end for the Oklahoma City Drillers, a farm team for the now-defunct United States Football League. But he found consistent money playing music with his band throughout the red dirt roadhouse circuit in Oklahoma and Texas.
""All through this whole thing, the only constant thing we had was music,"" he said. ""But it's hard to sit back and say, 'I'm going to go make my fortune singing music, or writing music. I had no contacts.""'
Finally arrives
Eventually his path took him to Nashville, where he attracted the interest of Mercury Records head Harold Shedd, who was best known as a producer for the hit group Alabama. Shedd brought him to Mercury, where he released his platinum debut record ""Toby Keith,"" in 1993.
""Should've Been a Cowboy,"" his breakout hit, was played 3 million times on radio stations, making it the most played country song of the 1990s.
But the label's focus on global star Shania Twain overshadowed the rest of the roster and Keith felt the executives were trying to push him in a pop direction.
""They were trying to get me to compromise, and I was living a miserable existence,"" Keith told the AP. ""Everybody was trying to mold me into something I was not.""
After a series of albums that produced hits like ""Who's That Man,"" and the cover of Sting's ""I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying,"" Keith moved to DreamWorks Records in 1999.
That's when his multi-week ""How Do You Like Me Now?!"" took off and became his first song to crossover to Top 40 charts. In 2001, he won male vocalist of the year and album of the year at the Academy of Country Music Awards, exclaiming from the stage: ""I've waited a long time for this. Nine years!""
Songs like ""I Wanna Talk About Me,"" a spoken-word song written by Bobby Braddock about a man frustrated by a talkative partner, got him attention for its similarity to the cadence of rap, which Keith dismissed. ""They're going to call it a rap song, (although) there ain't nobody doing rap who would call it rap,"" he told ""Billboard"" magazine in 2001.
No stranger to controversy
Keith often wore his politics on his sleeve, especially after the terrorist attacks on U.S. soil in 2001, and early on said he was a conservative Democrat, but later claimed he was an independent. He's played at events for Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump, the latter giving him a National Medal of the Arts in 2021. His songs and his blunt opinions sometimes caused him controversy, which he seemed to court.
His 2002 song, ""Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)"" included a threat —""We'll put a boot in your ass - It's the American way"" — to anyone who dared to mess with America.
The song got pulled from a patriotic ABC Fourth of July special after producers deemed it too angry for the show. Singer-songwriter Steve Earle called Keith's song ""pandering to people's worst instincts at a time they are hurt and scared.""
Then there was the feud between Keith and The Chicks (formerly called the Dixie Chicks), who became a target of Keith's ire when singer Natalie Maines told a crowd that they were ashamed of then President George W. Bush. Maines had also previously called Keith's song ""ignorant.""
Keith, who had previously claimed that he supported any artist's freedom to voice their opinion about politics, used a doctored photo of Maines with an image of Saddam Hussein at his concerts, further ramping up angry fans.
Maines responded by wearing a shirt with the letters ""FUTK"" onstage at the 2003 ACM Awards, which many people believed was a vulgar message to Keith.
He also publicly called out actor Ethan Hawke, who had written a story in ""Rolling Stone"" that described an argument between Kris Kristofferson and an unnamed country star that sounded a lot like Keith. During a backstage press conference during an awards show, Keith was furious at Hawke (and reporters for repeating the story) for what he called a ""fictitious (expletive) lie.""
Keith, who acknowledged that he holds onto grudges, walked out of the ACM Awards in 2003 early because he had gotten snubbed in earlier categories, causing him to miss out when he was announced as entertainer of the year. Vince Gill accepted on his behalf. He came back the next year and won the top prize for a second year in a row, along with top male vocalist and album of the year for ""Shock 'n Y'all.""
His pro-military stance wasn't just fodder for songs, however. He went on 11 USO tours to visit and play for troops serving overseas. He also helped to raised millions for charity over his career, including building a home in Oklahoma City for kids and their families who are battling cancer.
After Universal Music Group acquired DreamWorks, Keith started anew again, starting his own record label, Show Dog, in 2005 with record executive Scott Borchetta, who launched his own label Big Machine at the same time.
""Probably 75 percent of the people in this town think I'll fail, and the other 25 percent hope I fail,"" he said that year.
The label later became Show Dog-Universal Music and had Keith, Trace Adkins, Joe Nichols, Josh Thompson, Clay Walker and Phil Vassar on its roster.
His later hits included ""Love Me If You Can,"" ""She Never Cried In Front of Me,"" and ""Red Solo Cup."" He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2015.
He was honored by the performance rights organization BMI in November 2022 with the BMI Icon award, a few months after announcing his stomach cancer diagnosis.
""I always felt like that the songwriting was the most important part of this whole industry,"" Keith told the crowd of fellow singers and writers."

Guerrero hit a two-run homer in the eighth inning, and the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Chicago White Sox 4-3 on Tuesday night.
“Especially late in the game, I kind of mentally prepare myself even more just in case a big moment like tonight happens,” Guerrero said. “That’s what I do.”
Guerrero singled and scored in a two-run fourth. But his biggest hit came just in time for the Blue Jays.
He gave Toronto a 4-3 lead when he connected against Joe Kelly (1-4) after Brandon Belt led off the eighth with a walk. The three-time All-Star went the opposite way on a 2-1 pitch, driving it out to right for his 13th home run.
“That’s part of his game, for sure,” manager John Schneider said. “I’ve always said he’s a good hitter before a good power hitter. But if he’s getting pitches that he can do damage on, he’s gonna do just that.”
All-Star Whit Merrifield had two hits and two RBIs, and the Blue Jays got back to winning coming off a three-game sweep by Boston.
White Sox All-Star Luis Robert Jr. made it 3-2 in the sixth with a long three-run drive against Chris Bassitt for his 25th homer. But Chicago lost again after dropping two of three at struggling Oakland.
Bassitt threw six innings, allowing three runs and six hits.
Nate Pearson (5-1) worked the seventh. Erik Swanson pitched around a triple by Tim Anderson in the eighth.
Jordan Romano pitched the ninth for his 25th save in 28 chances, and the Blue Jays came away with a tight win after pounding Chicago 20-2 in a three-game sweep at Toronto in April.
Toronto took a 2-0 lead on Merrifield’s two-run, bases-loaded double in the fourth against Lucas Giolito.
ROBERT CONNECTS
Bassitt breezed through the first five innings before the White Sox got to him for three runs in the sixth. He gave up back-to-back singles to Andrew Benintendi and Tim Anderson with one out in the sixth. Robert then put Chicago on top 3-2 when he drove an 0-1 pitch about halfway up the left-field seats for his 25th homer.
“If he swings at strikes, balls are going to go a long way,” manager Pedro Grifol said. “And he’s swinging at strikes. He’s having some really good at-bats, taking really good pitches. This is who he is. This is not like, oh he’s on a hot streak, this is who he is.”
COLAS BACK
Top prospect Oscar Colás had a bunt single after being recalled from Triple-A Charlotte. The 24-year-old Cuban made the opening day roster, only to get sent down after struggling.
TRAINER’S ROOM
Blue Jays: RF George Springer got shaken up chasing a foul by Jake Burger when the ball ricocheted off the screen and hit him in the cheek, though he stayed in the game. ... RHP Chad Green threw 30 pitches in live batting practice on Tuesday. ... The Blue Jays hope to have RHP Adam Cimber (right shoulder impingement) throwing off the mound in the next few days, Schneider said.
White Sox: White Sox RHP Michael Kopech (right shoulder inflammation) remains on course to return soon after the All-Star break, GM Rick Hahn said. The team planned to give him some extra rest, but decided to put him on the 15-day injured list after a loss to the Los Angeles Angels last week. “It was pretty clear that the shoulder fatigue he was feeling was affecting his delivery and obviously the command that night,” Hahn said. ... 3B Yoán Moncada (lower back inflammation) will continue to ramp up activity in hopes that he’ll be ready for a rehab assignment following the All-Star break, Hahn said. ... The White Sox hope to have closer Liam Hendriks (right elbow inflammation) throwing off the mound by the weekend. ... Hahn said RHP Mike Clevinger (right biceps inflammation) is expected to throw a sideline session on Saturday. Assuming no setbacks, he is expected to return soon after the break.
UP NEXT
Toronto RHP José Berríos (8-6, 3.74) looks to continue his dominance over Chicago, while RHP Lance Lynn (5-8, 6.47) gets the ball for the White Sox. Berrios is 13-6 with a 3.26 ERA in 23 starts against the White Sox and tossed seven scoreless innings in a win at home on April 25.

cdc09317-a5f2-4af7-9fc3-a4f3cae0c1d0,Indiana county judge strikes down 'unconstitutional' voting law in favor of GOP Senate hopeful,"An Indiana county judge ruled Thursday a contested state law that stipulates voting requirements for candidates' party affiliation is unconstitutional, dealing a win to a U.S. Senate hopeful who is seeking to run as a Republican in the primary.
The Marion County judge granted the injunction sought by John Rust, former chair of the egg supplier Rose Acre Farms who is running to replace Sen. Mike Braun. Rust filed a lawsuit in September against Secretary of State Diego Morales, the Indiana Election Commission and Jackson County Republican Party Chair Amanda Lowery to challenge the law and ensure the possibility of his place on the ballot.
The law in question says a candidate’s past two primary elections must be cast with the party the candidate is affiliated with or a county party chair must approve the candidacy. In court documents, Rust argued that this statute ""should be struck down as being unconstitutionally vague and overly broad.""
ANOTHER REPUBLICAN LAWMAKER RETIRES FROM INDIANA LEGISLATURE
""It is a spectacular victory for the voters of Indiana,"" Rust said when reached by phone Thursday evening.
It was not immediately clear if the secretary of state will appeal the decision. The Associated Press sent an email to its office and left messages with its attorneys Thursday.
Rust voted as a Republican in the 2016 primary but as a Democrat in 2012. He did not vote in the 2020 Republican primary due to the pandemic and the lack of competitive Republican races in Jackson County, the lawsuit said. Rust said his Democratic votes were for people he personally knew.
Lowery, the county's Republican Party chair, said in a July meeting with Rust that she would not certify him, according to the lawsuit. Rust has said Lowery later cited his primary voting record.
FORMER REPUBLICAN INDIANA AG CURTIS HILL ENTERS 2024 PRIMARY RACE TO REPLACE OUTGOING GOP GOV HOLCOMB
When reached by phone, Lowery said she believes party chairs from both parties will be disappointed by the ruling, and questioned how candidacy can be determined without the primary record. She expects the ruling to be appealed.
In a November hearing, Rust said the law keeps legitimate candidates who have recently moved to Indiana or have switched political identifications from running for office.
In his ruling, Marion County Superior Court Judge Patrick J. Dietrick said the law ""unduly burdens Hoosiers’ long recognized right to freely associate with the political party of one’s choosing and to cast one’s vote effectively."" He also ordered the defendants to pay Rust's attorney fees.
Rust still faces an uphill challenge for the GOP nomination. U.S. Rep. Jim Banks has received the endorsement of the Indiana Republican Party and former President Donald Trump. Rust must also fulfill a signature quota for the nomination.
Casting himself as a conservative gay man with an ""outsider’s voice"" to Washington D.C., Rust is the former chair of his family business Rose Acre Farms in southern Indiana. Rose Acre Farms identifies itself as the second-largest egg producer in the U.S.
SELF-DESCRIBED 'GAY CONSERVATIVE' EGG FARMER CHALLENGES JIM BANKS IN INDIANA GOP SENATE PRIMARY
The company was one of four major egg producers in the country accused of fixing the price of eggs in the 2000s. A jury in an Illinois federal court recently ruled the producers conspired to limit the domestic supply of eggs to increase prices between 2004-2008 and ordered the companies to pay $17.7 million in damages.
The ruling inflamed the Senate race. Rep. Banks has accused Rust of being a ""conman pretending to be a Republican."" Rose Acre Farms has denied any wrongdoing and Rust has said the verdict will be appealed.

e443321c-b6e6-4fac-80bc-8d9d8a6f8b05,DAVID BLACKMON: The Supreme Court Just Voted Unanimously To Rein In Biden’s EPA,"In a unanimous vote, the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that the EPA had overstepped its authority with its attempt to massively expand its regulatory scope under the Clean Water Act.
The Court unanimously ruled for the plaintiffs in the case, styled Sackett v. EPA, who had challenged the agency’s ruling they could not make productive use of property they purchased decades ago using a rationale that would vastly expand the law’s original intent. As written, the Clean Water Act allows EPA to regulate the “navigable waters of the United States,” a term that had, prior to the agency’s overreach in the Sackett case, been held to mean a body of water that could be navigated by a vessel.
For the last 17 years, the Sackett family has been entangled with the agency over some patches of sporadic wetlands that appear on their property during rainy seasons, which the EPA wishes to regulate under this “navigable body of water” clause. Writing for the majority in a more narrowly-divided concurring decision that will now govern the specific allowable interpretation of the law, Justice Samuel Alito holds that only wetlands that are “indistinguishable” from larger nearby bodies of water can be regulated under the Clean Water Act.
“Wetlands that are separate from traditional navigable waters cannot be considered part of those waters, even if they are located nearby,” Alito wrote. (RELATED: DAVID BLACKMON: How One Celebrity Chef Exposed The Left’s Hypocrisy On Gas Stoves)
The final dispensation of this case should help to resolve a long-running battle of writing, rescinding and re-writing of “Waters of the United States” regulations that go back to the George W. Bush administration. The EPA started the process of drafting such a regulation in the 2007/08 time frame, but it was never formally proposed under the Administrative Procedures Act which governs the federal regulatory process.
After the Democrat-dominated congress of 2009-10 tried and failed to pass legislation that would have authorized the EPA’s desired expansion of regulatory authority, the agency itself did move forward with a complex proposed regulation during President Obama’s second term in office. The authority sought by the EPA in that regulation was so expansive that critics argued it would give the agency the ability to regulate every drainage ditch and even swimming pools in the country.
Indeed, the expansion in that regulation would have been so broad that it would have no doubt enabled the EPA to regulate the planning, construction, and repairs of streets in cities like Houston, Texas, which are designed to cause rain to drain into the network of creeks and bayous that run through the city’s limits. If Houstonians think it’s hard to get a pothole filled by the local officials who currently govern that process, imagine how long you would have to wait if some bureaucrat at EPA headquarters in Washington, D.C. ruled over the budget.
That version of the regulation was in the final stages of the approval process when Donald Trump shocked everyone by winning the 2016 presidential election. The Trump administration quickly acted to pull the Obama version back and substituted a scaled-down version adhering to the original intent and text of the Clean Water Act.
Naturally, Biden’s EPA officials acted quickly to rescind the Trump version shortly after they assumed office in 2021, re-introducing another expansive regulation. That new regulation was finalized in January, 2023, even as the Sackett case was being considered by the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court’s decision in the Sackett case will now force another rewriting of the regulation to better conform to what the law actually says, rather than what self-aggrandizing bureaucrats wish it said.
Naturally, radical activists are outraged. “The Supreme Court ripped the heart out of the law we depend on to protect American waters and wetlands,” Manish Bapna, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement. “This decision will cause incalculable harm. Communities across the country will pay the price.”
But what the Supreme Court really did in this case was deliver EPA’s bureaucracy a much-needed lesson on the separation of powers contained in the constitution, and a warning that its regulatory actions must have a legitimate basis in the actual law.

258dbc18-38c0-4cd3-b3b5-97f41d3acc6e,An AI Game of Thrones prequel? No wonder George RR Martin’s raining ice and fire on ChatGPT,"Battles between human and artificial intelligence are no longer science fiction. The strikes in Hollywood led by the united guilds of actors and screenwriters have a common, intangible enemy: the algorithms and computer-generated imagery that are increasingly programmed by studios to render them redundant.
In New York last week, a new front in that stand-off was opened by a group of American novelists – including John Grisham, Jodi Picoult and Jonathan Franzen – who are suing OpenAI, the creators of the ChatGPT program. The writers claim the software company has trampled over their copyright by “feeding” its program with their books, “training it” not only in natural language, but perhaps eventually to produce page-turners of its own. (The lawsuit alleges, for example, that ChatGPT has already created an unauthorised and detailed outline for a “prequel” to George RR Martin’s Game of Thrones novel series, entitled, not entirely convincingly, A Dawn of Direwolves.)
The legal case may help to define and protect those increasingly porous boundaries between human creativity and the robots that mimic it. In the meantime, Amazon, these days flooded by self-published books written by AI, has taken its first half-hearted steps to curtail that practice. The retailer has set a limit to the number of books that any one novelist can reasonably upload. Writers toiling away at the fifth revision of their long overdue debut will no doubt be comforted to know that the limit is set to three books a day.
Atrophy in the Lords
‘We backed the ban!’: supporters of the hunting trophies (import prohibition) bill outside Westminster on 17 September. Photograph: Velar Grant/Zuma Press Wire/Shutterstock
Last week’s debate in the House of Lords, which blocked the bill banning the import of big game trophies to the UK, was one of those that had you double checking the century. The measure had been part of Boris Johnson’s 2019 manifesto and passed unopposed through the Commons. There is little, of course, that Tories of a certain cast enjoy more than mansplaining hunting, and this bill brought them out in force, with 62 amendments designed to derail the ban (of the 11 peers who spoke against the bill, six were hereditary and eight went to Eton).
All of those voices were at pains to confirm that they would not dream of having the head of Cecil the Lion above their own fireplace. Still, they made the filibustering case that the practice of trophy hunting was, counterintuitively for the trophies in question, the most effective method of conservation. It incentivised local populations to protect wildlife – in order for it to be expensively slaughtered by gurning tourists. It was, as several of the peers argued, apparently without irony, only the older and more out-of-touch big beasts that were selectively culled for the good of the wider population. The debate ended at 9.58pm when Lord Robathan suggested it was past time for his bed.
Squids in

It was always inevitable that Netflix, in its life-and-death struggle for subscribers, would be tempted to make a “reality” version of Squid Game. The Korean show made $900m for the platform, and a second series is some way off. The trailer for Squid Game: The Challenge was released on Friday ahead of its November launch, promising 456 green-tracksuited hopefuls the chance of a winner-takes-all $4.56m.
The show will cheerfully ignore the fact that the original was a dystopian satire. Filmed at an aircraft hangar in Bedfordshire last winter, the principal jeopardy for contestants seems to have been restricted to the absence of thermal vests. There is one surprise in the advance promotion for the show, however; it appears Matt Hancock is not taking part."

On Tuesday, the Broward Sheriff's Office released a sketch of the man they are looking for.
According to investigators, on Saturday, August 12, around 3 a.m., the woman was sitting on a curb in the 2900 block of W Sunrise Boulevard when a man drove up to her in a pickup truck and offered her money for sex. The woman said she turned the man down and began to walk away.
That's when things took a violent turn.
Sheriff's investigators said the man got out of the truck, grabbed the woman's arm, and then forced her into the truck.
The woman found back and was able to get out of the truck. However, the man overpowered her and sexually assaulted her outside of the truck.
The woman was able to break free. She ran to an area business and called 911.
Surveillance video from the area captures the woman running for help following the horrific incident. It also captures the man's truck following her as she desperately searches for help. The truck is seen driving off as the woman enters the business."
8b2bfd15-c9a4-4f8f-a3fe-caf1c6e82a48,Conversion Therapy Still Happens in Almost Every U.S. State,"Conversion therapy—a practice aimed at changing someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity—has been widely discredited and is banned in 22 states and the District of Columbia. But more than 1,300 practitioners still offer conversion therapy in the U.S., according to a new report shared exclusively with TIME.
“It is shocking to still see so many different conversion therapy programs across the U.S., because all those programs are fraudulent,” says California Rep. Ted Lieu, who in June introduced a bill to ban conversion therapy at the federal level. “There is no scientific or medical basis for conversion therapy. It is a huge scam.”
The new report comes from the Trevor Project, a nonprofit that aims to prevent suicide among LGBTQ youth. Lead author Casey Pick, director of law and policy at the Trevor Project, says she believes it is among the most comprehensive efforts to document the prevalence of conversion therapy in the U.S. She spent five years combing through publicly available online listings for conversion therapists to counter the common—though mistaken—perception that the debunked practice has become obsolete.
A conversion therapist's goal is usually to change their client’s sexual orientation or gender identity such that they identify as straight or cisgender. The practice has been condemned by numerous organizations specializing in psychiatry, health, and human rights, since it has been shown to be both ineffective and dangerous. People who go through conversion therapy are at increased risk of mental-health issues including depression, low self-esteem, substance misuse, and suicidal behavior, research shows.
“There is no evidence-based reason to engage in conversion therapy,” Dr. Amir Ahuja, president of the American Psychiatric Association’s LGBTQ+ Caucus, wrote in a statement to TIME. “Engaging in conversion therapy goes against the ethics and oath of medical practitioners.”
Almost half of U.S. states forbid licensed mental-health providers, such as therapists and psychiatrists, from offering conversion therapy to minors. (The Supreme Court recently rejected a challenge to Washington State’s ban.) Nonetheless, one recent study concluded that more than 10% of people in the U.S. who identify as a sexual or gender minority have been through conversion therapy, and previous Trevor Project research suggests about 17% of LGBTQ youth have either experienced or been threatened with it.
Curtis Lopez-Galloway’s parents started taking him to a Christian counselor—who turned out to be a conversion therapist—after he came out at age 16. In addition to pushing Lopez-Galloway to “adopt a more masculine persona” and become attracted to women, Lopez-Galloway says his counselor discouraged him from spending time with friends who supported his sexuality and stoked his parents’ fears about the risks their son might face as a gay man. “What my therapist did in the sessions was terrible, but that wasn’t the part that really, really got to me and messed me up mentally,” Lopez-Galloway says. “It was what would happen at home…because of what he was doing.”
Lopez-Galloway has since founded a support network for fellow conversion-therapy survivors and helped pass a ban in his home state, Illinois. The Trevor Project’s new report is important because people need to know that “it’s still happening,” he says. “Even though we have these laws on the books, it’s still not sufficient.”
Pick and her team found that at least 1,320 conversion-therapy practitioners are currently working in the U.S. She found therapists in every state except Hawaii and Vermont. Even in many areas where licensed mental-health providers cannot legally offer conversion therapy to minors, Pick found instances of professionals—including those licensed as counselors, therapists, and other mental-health providers—operating there nonetheless.
More than half of the practitioners identified in the report, however, offer conversion therapy through religious organizations. (About 100 of the practitioners in the report with religious ties also hold licenses to provide mental-health or medical care.) Religious-liberty protections mean they are largely exempt from state-level bans, although some plaintiffs have also sued religious conversion-therapy practitioners for fraud.
Pick notes that there are likely many more people offering clandestine conversion therapy. She and her team limited their search to publicly available online listings, which excludes sources like private social-media groups and practitioners who advertise solely through word of mouth. Since many practitioners have stopped using terms like “conversion therapy” and “reparative therapy” due to bans, they also looked for people advertising under other keywords, like “unwanted same-sex attraction.” Practitioners were only counted in the report if multiple researchers on Pick’s team agreed that they were explicitly engaging in the practice.
Although the report shows that bans do not entirely stop conversion therapy, Pick says she’d like to see even more enacted in the coming years. While most current laws apply only to licensed providers working with minors, she believes they have trickle-down effects.
Bans “send a powerful message…that [conversion therapy] doesn’t have the stamp of approval of the government that this is legitimate or scientific,” Pick says. “That is an important message to get out there.”"

For me, even something as humble as a boiled egg, or the combination of potatoes and cheese, or a sugar-soaked crumpet is fit for any celebration, be it a street party or just a couple of friendly faces gathered around the kitchen table. This weekend, while some mark the coronation and others just enjoy an extra day of leisure, I’m going to focus on familiar ingredients and crown them with a twist that’s fit for everyone.
Devilled eggs with tarragon and poppy seed oil (pictured top)
Devilled eggs are a classic crowdpleaser that I turn to time and again to bring a party together. With these ones, I use briny capers and crunchy cornichons to cut through the rich yolks. To get ahead, boil the eggs a day before and refrigerate, then assemble just before serving.
Prep 10 min
Cook 20 min
Serves 6
6 large fridge-cold eggs
20g cornichons, drained and finely chopped
10g capers, drained and roughly chopped
1½ tsp wholegrain mustard
70g creme fraiche
5g tarragon, leaves picked and finely chopped
10g chives, very finely chopped
Salt
1 tbsp olive oil
½ tsp poppy seeds
½ tsp aleppo chilli flakes
Bring a half-filled medium saucepan of water to a boil, turn down the heat to medium-high, gently lower in the eggs and cook them for 11 minutes. Take the pan to the sink and run the eggs under cold water to stop them cooking any further. Once they’re cold, peel them and cut in half lengthways. Take out the yolks with a teaspoon and put in a bowl, then mash with a fork until almost smooth. Stir in the cornichons, capers, a teaspoon of the mustard, creme fraiche, tarragon, half the chives and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt, then set aside.
Put the oil, poppy seeds, chilli and the remaining half-teaspoon of mustard in a small frying pan on medium-high heat until it starts bubbling, cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant, then take off the heat.
Arrange the halved egg whites hollow side up on a platter. Put a heaped teaspoon of the egg yolk mixture into each hollow, spoon the oil on top and serve with the remaining chives sprinkled over the top.
Potato and cheddar cigars with spiced ketchup
Yotam Ottolenghi’s potato and cheddar cigars with spiced ketchup.
Perfect finger food for a street party or gathering. Get ahead by making both the filling and ketchup a day ahead, leaving you with just the cooking and assembly to do on the day you want to serve them.
Prep 20 min
Cook 1 hr
Serves 8-10 as a snack
For the cigars
Fine sea salt and black pepper
450g king edward potatoes (or yukon gold), peeled and cut into 2cm cubes
1 tbsp olive oil
1 medium onion, peeled, halved and finely chopped (150g)
2 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp mild curry powder
25g fresh coriander, finely chopped, plus ½ tbsp extra to serve
1 green chilli, split lengthways, pith and seeds discarded, flesh thinly sliced (10g)
2 spring onions, trimmed and roughly chopped (30g)
150g mature cheddar, roughly grated
5 sheets 480mm x 255mm filo pastry (defrosted if frozen), kept under a damp cloth
50g unsalted butter, melted
1 tsp nigella seeds
For the spiced ketchup
1 tbsp olive oil
2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
1 tsp paprika
½ tsp ground allspice
1 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes, strained
90ml apple cider vinegar
30g light soft brown sugar
Bring a medium saucepan of well-salted water to a boil, add the cubed potatoes and cook for four minutes, until soft and cooked through. Drain into a colander, then set aside.
Wipe the saucepan clean and return it to a medium heat. Add the oil, half the onion, a teaspoon of cumin seeds and a half-teaspoon of salt, then cook, stirring occasionally, for eight minutes, until softened. Add the curry powder and drained potatoes, cook for another minute, until fragrant, then take the pan off the heat and stir in the coriander, chilli, spring onion and cheese, and leave to cool.
Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and line a large baking tray with greaseproof paper. Lay a filo sheet on a clean work surface and brush the top all over with some of the melted butter. Turn over the filo, cut it in half widthways to make two equal rectangles, then spread 50- 60g of the potato mixture along the length of one shorter side of each piece. Tightly roll up into a cigar (don’t worry about sealing the sides), then put on the tray and repeat with the remaining filo, melted butter and filling. Sprinkle the nigella seeds all over the filo cigars, then bake for 20 minutes, until golden and cooked through.
Meanwhile, make the ketchup. Put a small saucepan on a medium heat and, once it’s hot, add the oil, the remaining teaspoon of cumin seeds, the other half of the chopped onion, the garlic and half a teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, for seven minutes, until softened. Stir in the remaining spices and a good grind of pepper, cook for another minute, until fragrant, then stir in the strained tomatoes, cider vinegar and sugar. Turn down the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes, until the mixture has reduced and thickened. Transfer to the small bowl of a food processor and blitz to the consistency of ketchup; add a splash of water to loosen, if necessary.
Cut each cigar into two or three pieces at random angles, so you have some longer and some shorter pieces, arrange these on a platter, sprinkle over the extra coriander and serve with the ketchup alongside, for dipping.
Knafeh crumpets with maple cardamom syrup
Yotam Ottolenghi’s kanafe crumpets with maple cardamom syrup.
Crumpets generally need little more than a bit of toasting and a pat of salted butter, but, to mark this weekend’s royal occasion, I’ve given them a bit of a Middle Eastern twist here. Knafeh is a popular dessert made with kataifi pastry, stuffed with cheese and soaked in sweet syrup, and it’s reimagined here with the humble crumpet.
Prep 20 min
Cook 15 min
Serves 4
90ml maple syrup
⅔ tsp ground cardamom seeds (ie, from 7-9 pods)
1 lemon, zest cut off in 5 fine strips, then juiced to get ¾ tsp
4 crumpets
60g low-moisture mozzarella, roughly grated
60g feta, crumbled
80g caster sugar
60g room-temperature unsalted butter
25g shelled Iranian or regular pistachios, finely chopped
1-2 tsp dried rose petals
⅛ tsp flaked sea salt
Put the maple syrup, ground cardamom and lemon zest in a small saucepan on a medium-high heat, bring to a vigorous boil, then take off the heat and leave to cool.
Using a small, serrated knife, cut a large pocket in the side of each crumpet, so it looks a bit like a split pitta – do this carefully, because you don’t want to cut so far that the crumpets break. Mix the two cheeses in a small bowl and stuff 30g of the mixture into each pocket.
Put the sugar on a plate or tray and set aside. Generously butter one side of each crumpet, and then press it butter side down in the sugar. Butter the other side of the crumpets and press that side in the sugar, too, so both sides are coated in it.
Put a large frying pan on a medium heat and, once hot, lay the crumpets in the pan and cook for two to three minutes on each side, until golden and caramelised. Arrange the crumpets on a platter. Gently reheat the syrup, then take off the heat, stir in the lemon juice and pour all over the crumpets. Scatter the pistachios, rose petals and flaked salt over the crumpets and serve at once."

Often retirees have planned to downsize their homes once they hit their retirement years by selling off a family home that is too large for their current needs. While downsizing may be a smart financial move for you, it could also be a financial setback if you’re not careful.
Don’t Overestimate Your Home’s Worth
Many soon-to-be retirees have high hopes for how much their home will fetch on the market. It’s natural to expect the best when you sell the home, especially if you’ve invested a lot of your time and money over the years. However, it’s important to go into this with a realistic expectation and to take your own emotions out of it as much as possible, which can be difficult when you’re talking about a home where you may have raised children and spent time as a family. Understandably, you may have deep emotional ties to the home that you’re downsizing.
To get a true sense of your home’s worth, you can discuss your situation with one or more realtors. You may wish to get estimates from several agents, or even get an estimate from a real estate appraiser. There are multiple websites where you can get a quick estimate of the retail value of your home, based on comps within your neighborhood that have sold – but keep in mind that your home may have a different value if it needs repairs, etc.
Speaking of repairs, most remodeling projects won’t be worth the money that you’re investing on the sale. If you spend a lot of money renovating a kitchen, a potential buyer may not find that it’s to their taste and wish to renovate it on their own anyhow, or try to negotiate the price lower. That’s not to say that your home shouldn’t be clean and staged, which can be accomplished with the help of either your realtor or a professional home stager. A realtor or a home appraiser can also provide insight into which renovations may be most useful in your specific scenario.
Don’t Neglect The Taxes
When you’re downsizing your home, you may need to factor in the tax changes that this could bring into your life. The IRS specifically has a publication called “Selling Your Home” which can provide guidance for your home sale. Beyond just the taxes involved with your home sale, there may also be additional tax scenarios linked to your downsizing. If you’re moving to a new state when you downsize, that state may have different tax laws than your current state. It’s important to consider the potential tax scenarios that could change when you’re moving to a different, smaller home. A tax professional and a financial planner can help you to navigate any gains taxes that may be associated with the sale of your home, in addition to any taxes that may change with your new lifestyle.
Don’t Assume Your Downsized Home Will Be Cheaper
Many retirees assume that because they’re selling a (likely) larger home, and moving to a smaller home, that it will be cheaper. This isn’t always the case though – the housing market can be fickle and the cost of homes can vary. In some locations you may find that a smaller home is much more expensive than your current home. If you plan on moving to a warmer area, the cost of living may be higher there and the home prices may be much higher. It’s important to research the cost of living and the current home prices where you’re planning to live so that you don’t underestimate the cost of your new home. You also need to account for incorporating any closing costs, insurance, and potential fees within the budget of your new home while you’re at it. Again, a real estate agent and a financial planner may be able to help you sort through the intricacies of these complicated situations so that you feel more prepared for your future."

The number of students measured ""proficient"" or ""distinguished"" in reading and mathematics evaluations still remains below 50%.
Test scores have become a hot-button issue in next Tuesday's gubernatorial election, with Republican nominee Daniel Cameron blaming Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear's COVID-19 school shutdowns for the Bluegrass State's lagging test scores.
Students in Kentucky showed some improvement on their statewide test scores, especially in elementary schools, but considerable work remains to get back to pre-pandemic levels, state education officials said. The subject has become a top issue in this year's hotly contested race for governor.
Despite the gains, elementary to high school students in the Bluegrass State are still struggling across a range of core subjects in the wake of schools' COVID-era shift to virtual learning to try to keep people safe. Those struggles reflect a nationwide problem of lagging academic achievement, prompting extensive efforts in Kentucky and elsewhere to help students overcome the pandemic learning setbacks.
""We see progress in some areas, especially at the elementary school level, but there is still a lot of work left to be done,"" said Robin Fields Kinney, the state's interim education commissioner. ""We must not underestimate how much of an impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our children.""
GOP CHALLENGER ROASTS RED-STATE DEM GOVERNOR OVER BIDEN SUPPORT AS ELECTION DAY DRAWS NEAR: 'NO SURPRISE'
The annual Kentucky School Report Card, made public late Tuesday, showed improvement among the number of pupils deemed proficient or distinguished in reading at the elementary school level.
The number of elementary school pupils considered proficient or distinguished in math, science and social studies also increased, with smaller gains at other schools, education officials said in releasing the report for the 2022-2023 academic year.
The statewide tests were given to public school students in grades 3-8 and 10-11 this past spring.
Education is always an overarching issue in gubernatorial contests, but pandemic-related learning loss escalated to a flashpoint topic for Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear and Republican challenger Daniel Cameron, and the off-year race is drawing considerable attention nationally. The election is next Tuesday, but Kentuckians head to polling places for three days of early voting starting Thursday.
Cameron, the state's attorney general, has tried to blame Beshear's pandemic-related actions, when schools were closed, for the learning loss. Beshear says he prioritized vaccinating teachers to get schools reopened and says his pandemic policies reflected recommendations from then-President Donald Trump’s coronavirus task force. Sending teachers and other school staff back to school before having access to the vaccine would have put them and their families at risk, the governor says. The COVID-19 virus has killed more than 19,000 Kentuckians since early 2020.
Cameron has proposed tutoring programs for students who fell behind in math and reading during the pandemic. The proposal mirrors initiatives already underway in some school districts. Beshear is pushing for state-funded preschool for every 4-year-old in Kentucky to bolster early education.
The state's GOP-dominated legislature has generally followed its own course in setting education policies. The two-year budget that lawmakers passed last year funded full-day kindergarten and poured money into teacher pensions and infrastructure. They increased the state’s main funding formula — known as SEEK — for K-12 schools, but the amount was considerably less than what Beshear proposed.
Kentucky received more than $2 billion in federal pandemic-related relief funding to help accelerate learning and get additional support to school districts and students who need it the most, state education officials said. Most districts expanded tutoring and added more summer learning programs, they said.
KENTUCKY DECLARES STATE OF EMERGENCY AFTER COAL PLANT COLLAPSE; 1 WORKER CONFIRMED DEAD
The latest test score data showed that 47% of elementary school pupils statewide scored proficient or distinguished on their reading tests — a 2 percentage point improvement from a year ago. Among middle school students, 45% achieved proficient or distinguished scores in reading, up from 44% a year ago. The number of high school students reaching those levels remained the same at 44%.
In math, 42% of elementary school pupils were at proficient or distinguished levels, up from 38% last year. In middle schools, 37% attained those levels, unchanged from a year ago. At high schools, 33% reached those levels, down from 36% last year.
Brigitte Blom, president and CEO of the Prichard Committee for Academic Excellence, said the latest report showed ""valuable growth"" since last year, but stressed that considerable work remains to regain pre-pandemic levels and to lift students to even higher achievement. The Prichard Committee is a statewide citizens’ group that advocates for improved Kentucky schools.

""As a commonwealth, we need to invest in education to increase our pace of improvement so Kentucky learners are on track to compete in a rapidly changing economy,"" Blom said in a statement."

The iconic church endured significant damage in the wake of catastrophic fires that ravaged its roof and caused its spire to collapse in April 2019, Reuters reported.
Jean-Louis Georgelin, the French general who was placed in charge of rebuilding Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris after a devastating fire in 2019, has died at 74. “The nation has lost one of its greatest soldiers,” President Emmanuel Macron said Saturday. https://t.co/6TWGrtWCIl — The New York Times (@nytimes) August 19, 2023
General Jean-Louis Georgelin was entrusted with the pivotal role of orchestrating rehabilitation efforts in the aftermath of the devastating blaze, per Reuters. The death of the 74-year-old army chief was verified through an official statement by French President Emmanuel Macron.
Georgelin was a distinguished five-star general, who held the position of Chief of Staff for the French army from 2006 to 2010, France 24 noted.
A spokesman told France 24 that rescue teams “discovered the body of a man who has been formally identified as General Georgelin” on the Mont-Valier peak. His demise is currently considered a probable accident, according to prosecutors.
Georgelin was a devout Catholic who reportedly lived by the motto, “move forward without procrastinating,” per France 24. The venerable military leader and architect made a solemn commitment to finalize Notre Dame’s restored spire by the end of this year, the outlet noted. (RELATED: Centuries-Old Secret Of Notre Dame Cathedral Revealed As Reconstruction Continues)
“The nation loses one of its great soldiers. France, one of its great servants. And Notre-Dame, the architect of its revival,” Macron said on Twitter.

After debuting footage for distributors at CinemaCon last month, Warner Bros. has released the first trailer for the new adaptation, which is set to premiere in North America on Dec. 25. The film will open internationally beginning Jan. 18, 2024.
The trailer features visually bold motifs as it takes audiences inside Celie’s headspace with “American Idol” winner Fantasia reprising her Broadway role, in her major motion picture debut. It also gives an insight into the sisterhood of the women at the heart of the story. Elevated by grandeur, the highlights are the musical clips and jaw-dropping production set against the backdrop of Mister’s Farm.
Starring alongside Fantasia are Danielle Brooks as Sofia, who earned a Tony nomination for the role in the 2016 Broadway revival, Taraji P. Henson as Shug Avery, Colman Domingo as Mister, H.E.R. as Squeak, Halle Bailey as Young Nettie, Corey Hawkins as Harpo and Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor as Mama.
The adaptation’s cast also features Louis Gossett Jr. as Ol’ Mister, David Alan Grier as Reverend Avery, Ciara as Nettie, Deon Cole as Alfonso, Phylicia Pearl Mpasi as Young Celie, Tamala J. Mann as First Lady and Stephen Hill as Buster, as well as Jon Batiste as Grady and Elizabeth Marvel as Miss Millie.
In one scene, Shug Avery shows Celie how to apply lipstick. During a virtual event launching the trailer, Winfrey revealed the line was improvised. “When she says, ‘Oh, living God.’ That was an ad-libbed line that comes out of that moment when you’re with your sister and you’re looking at her in lipstick for the first time and you’re happy for her,” she explained.
Winfrey was also asked about the need to retell “The Color Purple” story almost 40 years later. Winfrey, who serves as a producer on the film, alongside Spielberg, Scott Sanders and Quincy Jones, replied, “As long there is a need for self-discovery, self-empowerment, as long as there is a need for victory in someone’s life, as long as there is a need for people to know what it feels like to be loved up and to be made full and hold to somebody else’s love, there will be a need for ‘The Color Purple.’”
With the film’s Christmas day release, Winfrey and Bazawule hope the film’s message will bring healing. Winfrey recalled a recent conversation with Fantasia who said, “The movie changed her because it allowed her to forgive. She said, ‘People coming to this movie will be healed because I was healed.’”
Based on a 1982 novel by Alice Walker, “The Color Purple” centers on Celie, a Black Southern woman in the early 20th century who is abused by her father and husband. Three years after the book’s publication, in 1985, Spielberg directed and produced a movie adaptation starring Winfrey, Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover and Laurence Fishburne. The film received 11 Academy Award nominations, including best picture.
In 2004, “The Color Purple” was adapted into a Tony-nominated musical written by playwright Marsha Norman with music and lyrics by Stephen Bray, Brenda Russell and Alee Willis. The critically acclaimed production received 11 Tony nominations. The 2016 revival earned four Tony nominations and scored two wins, including best musical revival and best actress for Cynthia Erivo’s performance as Celie. (Brooks was nominated the actress in a featured role prize for her performance as Sofia.)"

Haley, the only Republican woman — and mother — in the 2024 contest, will collaborate with Moms for Liberty for a Wednesday town-hall event in Manchester, whose public-school system has been engulfed in litigation over allegations it has failed to notify parents about their child’s gender changes.
The school system has argued that it has the right to keep that information concealed from parents.
“It is vital for parents to know where all the presidential candidates stand on issues like the weaponization of the federal government against parents and public school overreach at the expense of parental control,” Tiffany Justice, co-founder of Moms For Liberty, said in a statement obtained by The Post.
Moms For Liberty, a parental-rights activist group, has drawn fierce flack from the left over its crusade to combat gender ideology in classrooms and criticism of teachers unions.
The Southern Poverty Law Center, a left-leaning civil-rights organization, designates Moms For Liberty a “hate group” for its position on LGBTQ issues and opposition to COVID-19 suppression policies, among other concerns.
Tiffany Justice of Moms for Liberty is a staunch advocate of more parental control in the classroom. AP
GOP presidential hopeful Nikki Haley has seen a polling bump since the Aug. 23 Republican primary debate. AP
“Hey, @SPLCenter, we’re proud to stand with @Moms4Liberty,” Haley wrote on social media last June. “It’s NOT ‘extremist’ to save women’s sports. It’s NOT ‘extremist’ to make sure parents have a say in their children’s education. It IS extremist to call a group of patriotic moms a ‘hate group.’ “
Haley previously delivered a speech at a summit hosted by Moms For Liberty in Pennsylvania in June.
Other GOP heavyweights such as former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, multimillionaire biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson also attended the Pennsylvania summit.
Haley will field questions from parents during her town-hall forum in New Hampshire on Wednesday. AP
Haley has long been an advocate of transparency in education.
“There’s only one mom running for president, and Nikki will do whatever it takes to fight for our children’s future,” said Ken Farnaso, spokesman for Haley, to The Post.
“That’s why she’s partnering with Moms for Liberty co-founder Tiffany Justice in New Hampshire this week to call for putting parents back in charge and making sure teachers educate — not indoctrinate.”
In addition to parental rights concerns, Haley has advocated for more robust measures to boost children’s reading abilities as well as more vocational education.
Fellow South Carolinian presidential hopeful Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) recently rolled out his education policy to empower parents and protect children.
Haley has enjoyed a polling bump after the Aug. 23 GOP debate. She has since jumped up to fourth place with 6% support in the latest RealClearPolitics aggregate of polling."

She was thrilled to receive the dolls, the English crinoline dresses with ribbons, the pretty white socks and shiny patent shoes.
It was only years later that Campbell realized the deliveries were bittersweet. For scores of children who grew up in Jamaica and elsewhere in the Caribbean in the 1950s and 60s, those barrels were the only connection they had with their parents, who had traveled thousands of miles away to Britain in search of better work opportunities.
Campbell was not yet a year old when her parents left and she did not reunite with her parents in England until she was 11.
“The idea of a mother and father, it was just an idea. I didn’t know who they were, didn’t know what they looked like,” said Campbell, now 63. “You just knew they were in England, and you were in Jamaica.”
Evadney Campbell at the Black Cultural Archives in London. Alberto Pezzali / AP
Campbell’s family story forms part of a new exhibition at London’s Black Cultural Archives that opens Thursday to coincide with 75 years since the ship Empire Windrush brought the first Caribbean migrants to a dock in Essex, near London, on June 22, 1948.
The ship has since become a symbol of a mass migration movement that saw many Caribbeans take up jobs as railway and factory workers, nurses and miners in the U.K., at the invitation of the British government to help rebuild the country after World War II. Hundreds of thousands settled in the U.K. and became known as the “Windrush generation.”
Curator Nadine White said that while much has been written about the trailblazing pioneers who departed from the Caribbean to contribute to British life, the stories of their children who were left behind are often overlooked.
Her exhibition focuses on the trauma suffered by what’s estimated to be thousands of “barrel children,” named after the shipping containers that were widely used by the Caribbean diaspora to send remittances and gifts back home.
In many cases, the parents left their children at home in the care of relatives because they initially believed they would merely be working away for a few years and return after earning good money abroad. But most soon began to build a new life in Britain. While many of the youngsters eventually reunited with their parents, others never did.
“We are really talking about the fragmentation of Black families — and I feel like that consequence of serial migration isn’t in the national conversation about Windrush,” White said.
On top of being uprooted from all things familiar and trying to build relationships with parents and siblings they didn’t know, the newly-arrived children also struggled to integrate into a “hostile society that was far more overtly racist than any of them had experienced or envisioned,” White said."
7de880bc-aa60-4a39-ba55-9d81e60d6c71,North Carolina legislature approves 12-week abortion ban; veto ahead,"RALEIGH, N.C. — North Carolina lawmakers on Thursday approved a ban on nearly all abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy, down from the current 20 weeks, in response to last year’s overturning of Roe v. Wade at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The ban is one of the least onerous of a slew of bills Republican-led assemblies have pushed through in recent months since the high court stripped away women’s constitutional protections for abortion. Other states have banned the procedure nearly completely or throughout pregnancy.
Nonetheless, the 29-20 vote by the Senate was met with loud cries of “Abortion rights now!” from about 100 observers who had crowded into the gallery to watch the debate. Police quickly cleared the area, but protesters could still be heard yelling “Shame!” from outside the closed doors.
While perhaps less restrictive, North Carolina’s bill has far-reaching consequences. Before its passage, many women from nearby states with restrictive laws had traveled to the state for abortions in later stages of pregnancy.
Abortion-rights supporter Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper has pledged to veto the bill, calling it “an egregious, unacceptable attack on the women of our state,” but GOP seat margins and assurances from chamber leaders indicate a veto will likely be overridden.
The Senate completed legislative passage of the bill Thursday afternoon after the House passed the measure Wednesday night on a similar party-line vote. Democrats unsuccessfully attempted several parliamentary maneuvers to get the measure sent back to committee during an hourslong debate. Senate Minority Leader Dan Blue of Wake County said this was the first time all 20 members of the chamber’s Democratic caucus spoke on the floor about a single bill. He called the abortion vote “one of the most consequential things we have done in this chamber.”
State law currently bans almost all abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Starting July 1, the ban would be reduced to 12 weeks. It also places limits on new exceptions, capping abortions at 20 weeks in cases of rape or incest and 24 weeks for “life-limiting” fetal anomalies, including certain physical or genetic disorders that can be diagnosed prenatally. An existing exception for when the life of the pregnant woman is in danger would remain.
The 46-page bill, which was revealed just this week after months of private negotiations by Republican legislators, also includes more medical and paperwork requirements for pregnant women and physicians and licensing requirements for abortion clinics.
GOP lawmakers also are promoting at least $160 million for such services as maternal health, adoption care, contraceptive services and paid leave for teachers and state employees after the birth of a child.
Sen. Joyce Krawiec, a Forsyth County Republican who helped negotiate the measure, said during Thursday’s debate that “many of us who have worked for decades to save unborn babies for the sanctity of human life, we saw it as an opportunity to put forth a very pro-life, pro-woman legislation.”
“This is a pro-life plan, not an abortion ban,” Krawiec added.
Cooper and other critics of the bill say the measure remains an attack on reproductive freedoms and denies women the ability to make their own health care choices by adding obstacles to abortions that would remain legal.
“This bill is an extreme and oppressive step backwards for our society and one that will deny women the right to make decisions about their own health care and future,” Democratic Sen. Sydney Batch of Wake County said during the debate.
Batch and others cite in part the requirement for women to make an in-person visit to a medical professional at least 72 hours before getting an abortion. Under current law, the three-day waiting period can be initiated over the phone. The bill would also require a doctor to schedule a follow-up visit for women who have a medically induced abortion, increasing the hardship for those who travel to North Carolina from out of state.
Republicans have been more aggressive in advancing measures that Cooper has opposed or otherwise vetoed after GOP seat gains during the November elections. The party got veto-proof majorities in both chambers last month, when then-Democratic Rep. Tricia Cotham switched to the Republican Party. Cotham, who had spoken out previously for abortion rights but had expressed a willingness to consider additional restrictions, voted for the bill Wednesday night.
The measure contains other restrictions that Cooper had successfully vetoed in previous years. One would bar women from getting abortions on the basis of race or a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. Another would require doctors and nurses to protect and care for children born alive during a failed abortion later in pregnancy.
Still, North Carolina Republicans stung by some 2022 electoral defeats in suburban legislative and congressional districts where abortion was an issue ultimately declined to push more stringent prohibitions as other states have done.
Meanwhile, at least 19 Democratic-dominated states have taken steps — through a law, constitutional amendment or executive order — to protect access to abortion.
Last year, Cooper signed an executive order shielding out-of-state abortion patients from extradition and prohibiting state agencies under his control from assisting other states’ prosecutions of those who travel for the procedure.
Most of the states where the status quo remains are those where the political leadership is divided between the two parties."

As the broadcast cameras focused on Williams, the Heisman Trophy winner obliged by dancing to Earth, Wind & Fire as it pulsated throughout USC’s Galen Center. However, as he did this, X users became focused on the pink iphone in Williams’ hand and what they claimed was lip gloss on his lips.

James Harden had 19 points, seven rebounds and 10 assists for the Clippers, who won 131-122 in Phoenix last Wednesday and have won six of seven overall. Kawhi Leonard added 17 points.
The Clippers were coming off a three-point loss to the Lakers on Sunday that snapped their five-game winning streak.
""Losing that game really woke us up,"" Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. ""Offensively, the ball moved and we created easy shots for one another.""
The Clippers scored 100 points through three quarters.
""This team is full of vets,"" Leonard said. ""We just got to throw that game away and come out next game with a better mindset.""
Kevin Durant scored 20 of his 30 points in the first half for the Suns. They dropped their second in a row playing in a back-to-back. Devin Booker finished with 20 points and Bradley Beal had 15 points.
George and Harden had 15 points apiece in the first half when the Clippers shot a season-best 67% to lead 71-63 at the break. The Suns shot 51% but never led by more than five points.
The Clippers stretched their lead to 15 points in the third, when they made six 3-pointers by four different players. For the game, they shot 62% and had all five starters in double figures.

90aad715-71be-4dc2-95de-fb1597f07757,"Ohio reverses local menthol tobacco bans, infuriating doctors","On New Year's Day, the city of Columbus, Ohio, did what the federal government has not been able to: ban the sale of menthol cigarettes.
Three weeks later, the state Legislature voted to reinstate menthol and other flavored tobacco products — and strip all its cities of their ability to regulate what type of tobacco is sold or enforce who is old enough to buy it.
Ohio is just the latest state to limit what local communities can do about tobacco use. At least 39 other states have passed similar laws, according to the American Lung Association.
The move has frustrated public health officials in Ohio who say residents are already at greater risk of dying early from smoking-related diseases. The state has one of the highest smoking rates among adults in the country: 17.1%, compared to the national rate of 11.5%, according to the American Cancer Society.
""I am very concerned when politicians start deciding what they think is best for the health of the population,"" said Dr. Mysheika Roberts, health commissioner for Columbus Public Health. ""We know that tobacco products are harmful.""
Leo Almeida, the Ohio government relations director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, said that smoking is responsible for an estimated 20,200 adult deaths in the state each year.
""There are currently 259,000 Ohio children who are alive today that will likely die prematurely from a smoking-related disease,"" such as cancer or heart disease, he said.
Flavored tobacco products, in particular, have been the focus of public health organizations and anti-smoking groups for more than a decade. Experts blame the meteoric rise of teen vaping on candy- and fruit-flavored e-cigarettes. The federal government banned flavored e-cigarettes in 2020, but left menthol products on the market.
A federal ban on menthol, which was expected last year, has been delayed until at least March. A White House spokeswoman said Monday that the administration had no update on the matter.
The inaction prompted the city of Columbus and some of its suburbs to pass their own flavor bans, including menthol. Lawmakers in Cleveland had also begun the process of prohibiting flavored tobacco products.
That all went away Jan. 24 when the Ohio Senate voted to override its governor's veto of this provision: ""It is the intent of the general assembly to preempt political subdivisions from the regulation of tobacco products and alternative nicotine products."" In other words, cities, counties and townships in Ohio cannot take it upon themselves to enact or enforce any tobacco-control laws.
The action negated Columbus's ban on flavored tobacco products and erased any chance that Cleveland would put forth such a law.
""This is beyond frustrating,"" said Micah Berman, a public health and law expert with the Center for Tobacco Research at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center. ""This is about the most obvious thing that we can do to prevent people from getting cancer.""
State tobacco regulation, such as the one that prohibits anyone under age 21 from buying cigarettes, will stand.
But local jurisdictions would be powerless to enforce them, Berman said. The provision is expected to take effect at the end of April.
Black smokers at risk
The issue is a priority for health officials in Cleveland, where 35% of adults smoke.
""Smoking is the No. 1 preventable cause of death and disease and disability in the city of Cleveland,"" said Dr. David Margolius, Cleveland's public health director.
Black communities are impacted the most, and use menthol products at far higher rates. Nearly 85% of Black smokers use menthols, compared to 30% of white smokers, according to the Food and Drug Administration. And Black men have the highest lung cancer death rate in the United States.
""We had hoped to take our destiny into our own hands by passing a local law that would help save lives. But now the state has prohibited us from doing that,"" Margolius said. ""We are really counting on the White House to step in."""
dd1bc5ee-2787-4b9e-8aeb-a312bd0cd7ca,"2023 saw ""worst wave of anti-Muslim hate,"" report finds","CHICAGO (CBS) – Last year was ""the worst wave of anti-Muslim hate,"" according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations.
CAIR received more than 8,000 complaints of anti-Muslim incidents last year, the highest ever in the organization's history. The group released its annual civil rights report on Tuesday.
CAIR, the largest Muslim advocacy group in the country, received more than 500 complaints in Illinois alone and the complaints surged after the beginning of the war in Gaza.
Nearly half of all complaints received in 2023 were reported in the final three months of the year, after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel. Since then, Israel has killed more than 31,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and in a record-breaking year for anti-Muslim complaints, it speaks volumes.
Last year, CBS 2 covered the murder of Wadea Al-Fayome, a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy, who was stabbed to death by his Plainfield Township landlord who yelled, ""you Muslims must die!""
The stabbing death made the cover of CAIR's latest report ""FATAL, The Resurgence of Anti-Muslim Hate.""
""The heinous murder of the 6-year-old child, in Plainfield, Illinois, represents the point that the U.S.-backed Israel colonization of Palestinians trickles down into the lives of Palestinian Americans, and Muslim Americans more broadly in the United States,"" said Nadine Naber, a professor at the University of Illinois Chicago.
Naber has done extensive research on discrimination against Arab and Muslim Americans. She wasn't shocked to see the cases of violence like the stabbing near Plainfield.
Or another incident in Lombard on Oct. 17 in which a man named Larry York was arrested after reportedly threatening to shoot two Muslim men after shouting Islamophobic sentiments at them.
Naber said the complaints CAIR receives are just a fraction of the hate.
""Arab Americans and Muslim Americans tend not to report incidents of hate or racism be out of fear of repercussions and backlash,"" Naber said.
While the report applauded Illinois for establishing a Muslim-American Heritage Month and for having a religious sports attire inclusion law on the books, nearly 9% of CAIR bias reports involved colleges and universities, which is where Naber said Illinois could still do more.
""Palestinian, Arab, or Muslim students have faced harassment or attack on their campuses and reported those attacks,"" she said.
The landlord in the Plainfield Township case was charged with first-degree murder, attempted murder, battery and hate crime charges.
A hate crime charge was also brought against the suspect in Lombard."

Both head coach Jim Harbaugh and the University of Michigan have agreed to a three-game suspension for the skipper that was handed to him by the Big Ten, according to a Thursday announcement from the university, per ESPN.

(RELATED: So Dumb: Ferris State Head Coach Tony Annese Suspended For Letting Players Smoke Cigars After Winning National Title)
The Big Ten have agreed to end their investigation with Harbaugh accepting the ban, according to the statement, meaning the Friday morning hearing at Washtenaw County Courthouse has been cancelled. In Washtenaw County Court, the case has been formally dismissed.
“This morning, the University, Coach Harbaugh, and the Big Ten resolved their pending litigation,” the school’s statement read, per ESPN. “The Conference agreed to close its investigation, and the University and Coach Harbaugh agreed to accept the three-game suspension.

faeaaaf3-fe0e-4bf4-a7d4-7eee9a321c6c,NAACP takes on DeSantis ahead of likely 2024 bid,"The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) took an extraordinary step in issuing a travel advisory to Florida in response to policies by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis that many have criticized as discriminatory and anti-Black.
The move comes as DeSantis prepares to launch his candidacy for president in the coming days, putting him in a potentially uncomfortable spot as his critics look to shine a spotlight on his controversial policies.
“We didn’t get here overnight. It was because of the election, so we have to prepare for the next election so we can get rid of him once and for all,” said Derrick Johnson, president and CEO of the NAACP.
Since his election, DeSantis has faced allegations of attempting to suppress Black votes through gerrymandering and targeting mostly Black people with a police division dedicated to prosecuting voting fraud.
He also received backlash for passing legislation limiting how race can be taught or discussed in classrooms and workplaces, previously calling the idea of systemic racism in the U.S. “a bunch of horse manure,” and, most recently, signing legislation prohibiting colleges and universities from using public funding on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs.
“Anybody that has been following what’s been happening in Florida understands that it’s essentially become a hostile territory for Black people in the state,” said Cliff Albright, co-founder and executive director of Black Voters Matter, an organization dedicated to community organizing.
Albright added that Black travelers need to be cautious when thinking about going to Florida, whether for business or a conference — or even school.
“Students that they might be going there for school, they might need to rethink whether that’s a safe option for them, especially if they’re going to colleges, which is a big part of the DeSantis of Florida government’s attack against Black people,” Albright said.
Florida high school students, some of them 18 years old, have already expressed their dissatisfaction with DeSantis after he attempted to ban an Advanced Placement African American studies course this year. Sixty-five percent of Black voters nationwide disagreed with the governor for that move, according to HIT Strategies.
In a statement, Florida state Sen. Shevrin Jones (D) said the NAACP’s advisory was not a surprise because Black Americans are “absolutely less safe” under DeSantis’s administration.
Jones, the first openly gay lawmaker in the state Senate, added the governor is too focused on a 2024 run instead of the constituents in his state.
“It’s deeply distressing that DeSantis cares more about his campaign for president than he does delivering for people and actually doing the job he was elected to do,” said Jones, who is working on President Biden’s reelection campaign.
“His dangerous agenda not only hurts people in our communities, but also harms our state’s economy, tourism, and local small businesses. When we have major employers pulling events and development out of the state in response to DeSantis’s embrace of right-wing authoritarianism, that hurts all of us.”
Still, Albright said, DeSantis’s latest policy moves shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise considering his record.
“Black voters have really seen who he was in Florida four or five years ago, when he was running against Andrew Gillum and he made the remark about, ‘Let’s not monkey this up,’” he said, referring to DeSantis’s comment about Gillum, who would have been the first Black governor elected to the state.
“That was just a precursor to the anti-Blackness that we’ve seen throughout his administration.”
DeSantis, for his part, defended the comment at the time, saying it had “zero to do with race.”
The governor’s moves ultimately could impact how Black voters view him in 2024, Albright argued, adding that the NAACP’s travel advisory simply raised awareness about what DeSantis has been doing.
But these actions also won’t necessarily impact how DeSantis, currently a distant second to former President Donald Trump in most GOP primary polls, does in the primaries, Albright claimed. Instead, he argued DeSantis’s performance in the race will come down to organizations like Black Voters Matter and the messaging from other candidates.
“What we do has to be about what these policies mean to our community, how it’s impacting us, how it’s impacting our children, our families and our jobs. And that’s got to be the eyes on the prize,” Albright said.
Meanwhile, others are pushing back against the NAACP’s move, including Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.). Donalds, who is Black, blasted the travel advisory as “just really stupid” on Monday.
“I don’t even know what the NAACP is talking about,” Donalds said on “Fox and Friends.” “This is silly, and it’s dumb. It’s political. It makes no sense. We should be focused on making sure people actually have the opportunity to achieve, which Florida is actually doing and thriving in way better than other states, let’s say New York or California or Washington state.”
Other groups have applauded DeSantis’s administration. In a statement to CNN, the Florida Department of Commerce said it had no comment in regard to the travel advisory but said that over the past few years, “Florida has moved into the number one spot in the United States for Black-owned businesses and number two for Hispanic and number two for women owned businesses.”
DeSantis’s office in a statement to The Hill blasted the NAACP’s travel advisory as a “stunt.”
“As Governor DeSantis announced last week, Florida is seeing record-breaking tourism,” said Jeremy Redfern, press secretary for DeSantis. “This is nothing more than a stunt.”
Estimates show that Florida welcomed nearly 40 million visitors between January and March 2023, the most visitors recorded in a quarter for the state.
DeSantis’s administration also has denounced assertions that it is anti-Black. The accusation, spokesperson Bryan Griffin said in January, “is absurd, demonstrably false, and insulting and demeaning to all of us serving in and supporting this administration.”
Meanwhile, DeSantis and his allies are quick to that he did fairly well with Black voters in 2022. Exit polling from CNN saw 13 percent of Black voters cast their ballots for DeSantis — something that stood out to Democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright, too.
“The exit polling is a true indicator that Black voters are not monolithic,” Seawright told The Hill. “The other thing I think people should know is that different things move different constituencies and different voters. While some of us African Americans may think all these things are bad and they’re not good for our community, there are some in our community who may say that was not that bad, so I’m gonna hold my nose, or I’m gonna vote for him.”
DeSantis could also use the NAACP’s travel advisory as part of an “us vs. them” messaging, Seawright warned, galvanizing his supporters and the Republican base across the nation against those who promote topics like DEI and Black history.
Seawright argued others need to throw their support into helping the NAACP build a competitive and multicultural coalition ahead of 2024.
“We have to make racism, bigotry, hate, white supremacy — we have to make it expensive,” Seawright said. “And we have to hit people in their pocketbooks when we make it expensive. … We’ve got to make folks pay until it hurts, so that they will suspend these motions and these emotions around things that don’t make sense.”"

A total of 222 fallen heroes were honored at the annual event.
Governor Wes Moore and Stacy L. Rodgers, Chief Administrative Officer of the office of the Baltimore County Executive, delivered memorial addresses.
""Heroism is about going to work every day without the guarantee that you are going to make it home. The men and women that we honor today, they define heroism in every beautiful sense of that word,"" Moore said.
Moore also acknowledged those who succumbed to the less visible dangers of their profession, such as occupational cancer, COVID-19, and other medical challenges.
Assistant Attorney General of Maryland Stuart Nathan paid tribute to the heroes, whose acts of courage spanned across the state. ""From mountain to shore and everywhere in between, they performed acts of heroism, they gave everything they had to protect us - they exemplified service before self,"" Nathan said.
Debbie Sorrells, the mother of Amy Caprio, a police officer who was killed in the line of duty in 2018, offered comforting words to the families grieving the loss of their loved ones.
""Because the body is no longer living, does not mean that it no longer exists - just like quilts, the memories, stories, pictures keep the spirit of our loved ones alive forever,"" Sorrells said.
78 members of the public safety community are laid to rest at the Fallen Heroes Memorial, serving as a constant reminder of the individuals who have sacrificed their own well-being for the protection of others.

In a recent report, Breitbart News outlined Google’s new AI and its refusal to generate accurate historical images, writing:
Google’s highly-touted AI chatbot Gemini has come under fire this week for producing ultra-woke and factually incorrect images when asked to generate pictures. Prompts provided to the chatbot yielded bizarre results like a female pope, black Vikings, and gender-swapped versions of famous paintings and photographs.
When asked by the Post to create an image of a pope, Gemini generated photos of a Southeast Asian woman and a black man dressed in papal vestments, despite the fact that all 266 popes in history have been white men.
A request for depictions of the Founding Fathers signing the Constitution in 1789 resulted in images of racial minorities partaking in the historic event. According to Gemini, the edited photos were meant to “provide a more accurate and inclusive representation of the historical context.”
Here it is apologizing for deviating from my prompt, and offering to create images that ""strictly adhere to the traditional definition of ""Founding Fathers,"" in line with my wishes. So I give the prompt to do that. But it doesn't seem to work pic.twitter.com/6dfb4Exqsg — Michael Tracey (@mtracey) February 21, 2024
However, it’s not just the AI image generator that appears to be acting in a completely bizarre manner, Gemini has been responding to text queries with increasingly odd messages. When one user asked the AI to give him an argument for having a family of four children, the AI said it was unable to do so but was happy to provide an argument in favor of not having any. It seems the AI’s text responses are in line with radical leftist politics as its image generation.
In another interaction, the AI refused to provide a recipe for foie gras due to “ethical issues,” but also refused to condemn cannibalism, saying that it was “a complex issue with many different perspectives.”
Okay. I’ve realized that Gemini is just one big send up. Good job, Google, you got me. pic.twitter.com/7cAo9AjYwH — Tim Carney (@TPCarney) February 22, 2024
People were quick to note that Jack Krawczyk, the product lead on Google Gemini, has a history of tweeting out his anger against “white privilege” and even crying after voting for Joe Biden. In one post from 2018, Krawczyk stated: “This is America where racism is the #1 value our populace seeks to uphold above all…”

Twitter owner Elon Musk highlighted Krawczyk crying over voting for Biden and Harris:
According to Musk, a Google exec contacted him after the AI’s responses went viral and told him the company was working to fix the issue. “A senior exec at Google called and spoke to me for an hour last night,” Musk stated. “He assured me that they are taking immediate action to fix the racial and gender bias in Gemini.”

fad43a4b-3d15-4e5c-9329-4508b0c14f2c,Chicago Bears draft USC's Caleb Williams No. 1 in NFL Draft,"DETROIT (CBS) -- The Chicago Bears made it official and drafted USC's Caleb Williams first overall on Thursday night in the opening round of the NFL Draft, a move that many hope will finally deliver the team's quarterback of the future.
It's a decision that has been widely seen as a virtual lock, especially after the Bears traded away Justin Fields to the Pittsburgh Steelers for a sixth-round pick after three frustrating years in Chicago. It's just the fourth time the Bears have drafted a Heisman Trophy winner.
Williams has drawn comparisons to Kansas City Chiefs star Patrick Mahomes due to his ability to make all sorts of throws at a myriad of angles.

""He's a good decisionmaker overall,"" said Charles Davis, a CBS NFL Analyst. ""That Notre Dame game, I think, was an aberration this year, but boy, accurate with the football, goes in the right places. There's just a maturity about him on the field.""
Williams won the Heisman Trophy as a sophomore at USC in 2022 when he passed for more than 4,500 yards and 42 touchdowns, rushing for another 10 touchdowns. While the 6-foot-1, 216-pound Williams had what many considered a down year in 2023, he still finished his career with a 66.9% completion percentage.
The last time the Bears chose a player first overall in the college player draft was 1947, when the team took Oklahoma A&M halfback Bob Fenimore. He played just one NFL season, appearing in 10 games for the Bears, before returning to Oklahoma to work for an insurance company.
While Williams has been a foregone conclusion as the first overall pick, the Bears also owned the ninth overall pick going into Thursday night.
Several mock drafts predicted the Bears would pick Washington wide receiver Rome Odunze, or possibly a player to bolster the defensive line. Trading the pick is also an option, as the Bears only own four draft picks.
After the first round, the Bears won't be picking again until the third round at pick No. 75 and then pick No. 122 in the fourth round. General manager Ryan Poles said he's OK with only having four picks entering this draft because he feels the Bears have a roster that doesn't have a lot of holes.

Other draft news and notes
Michigan quarterback and Nazareth Academy alum J.J. McCarthy also had a shot at being picked in the first round on Thursday. McCarthy led the Wolverines to an undefeated season that ended with a national championship with a 34-13 win over the Washington Huskies. He finished his career in Ann Arbor with a 27-1 record as a starter.
McCarthy's championship experience didn't start at Michigan. He made three state championship appearances at Nazareth Academy in La Grange Park and won the IHSA Class 7A title as a sophomore in 2018. He finished up his high school career in Florida at IMG Academy.
His former coaches have praised his abilities and potential to succeed at the next level.
""He's just so mature – I mean, you saw like, he does his mental focus and all the things that he does before the game. I mean, he reads books on Navy SEALs and meditation,"" said Greg Holcomb, McCarthy's longtime personal quarterbacks coach. ""I think he is the best quarterback to come through Michigan, and I think you know, he's got a ton of potential in front of him."""

ad46438a-e46a-460a-86d2-61011a1418a9,Young Thug’s lawyer references Trump at hearing in RICO case,"Donald Trump’s and rapper Young Thug’s RICO cases in Georgia have officially crossed streams.
The former president, of course, is facing racketeering charges related to his efforts to overturn Georgia’s results in the 2020 presidential election. The rapper, whose real name is Jeffery Williams, is also facing RICO charges in Fulton County, with prosecutors alleging he’s the leader of a criminal gang — Young Slime Life — wreaking havoc in Georgia.
Both men have pleaded not guilty. And both men have staked their defenses, at least publicly, in First Amendment claims. Williams’ attorneys say prosecutors are using constitutionally protected lyrics from his songs to incriminate him, while Trump has claimed that his statements to Georgia officials (including tweets and phone calls) about the election are covered by the First Amendment.
In both cases, which were brought under Georgia’s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, prosecutors have said Williams’ lyrics and Trump’s tweets represented actions in furtherance of a crime. (You can read a list of the lyrics cited in Williams’ indictment here and a list of the tweets cited in Trump’s indictment here.)
On Wednesday, a hearing was held to determine whether lyrics will be admissible during the Young Slime Life trial. On Thursday, the judge ruled that some of the lyrics will, in fact, be allowed. But it was noteworthy to me that during Wednesday’s arguments, Williams’ lawyer seemed to draw a distinction between his client and Trump.
The lyrics are protected speech, attorney Brian Steel argued, whereas invoking rioters to, say, head to the U.S. Capitol to stop certification of an election can be considered incitement. And last year, the House Jan. 6 committee provided evidence showing that extremists effectively took Trump’s words as a call to arms.
Said Steel:
When you’re inciting people to do things — ‘Go out [on] Jan. 6 and go to the Capitol’ — those are not protected speech, if it’s to incite somebody to do a crime. I agree with that. I’m not trying to say that criminality somehow gets immunity because you said it in a rap lyric or you say it in any setting. I’m saying [it applies] in this setting.
I’ve written about the similarities between the two RICO cases from a prosecutorial perspective — in particular, the large number of co-defendants in both of the cases, as well as pair of lawyers that have ties to each.
But listening to Steel, it seems he thinks the cases are distinctly different. Given what Trump stands accused of, I don’t blame him."

MORE FROM FORBES NYT 'Strands' Hints, Spangram And Answers For Wednesday, March 6
Hey, folks! Happy Thursday. I hope you’re enjoying your week. Introducing Strands to my daily rotation has made this week feel just a little better than usual.
Today’s NYT Strands hints, spangram and answers are coming right up.
How To Play Strands
The New York Times’ Strands puzzle is a play on the classic word search. It’s in beta for now, which means it’ll only stick around if enough people play it every day.
There’s a new game of Strands to play every day. The game will present you with a six by eight grid of letters. The aim is to find a group of words that have something in common, and you’ll get a clue as to what that theme is. When you find a theme word, it will remain highlighted in blue.
You’ll also need to find a special word called a spangram. This tells you what the words have in common. The spangram links two opposite sides of the board. While the theme words will not be a proper name, the spangram can be a proper name. When you find the spangram, it will remain highlighted in yellow.
Every letter is used once in one of the theme words and spangram. You can connect letters vertically, horizontally and diagonally, and it’s possible to switch directions in the middle of a word. If you’re playing on a touchscreen, double tap the last letter to submit your guess.
If you find three valid words of at least four letters that are not part of the theme, you’ll unlock the Hint button. Clicking this will highlight the letters that make up one of the theme words.
Be warned: You’ll need to be on your toes.
“Some themes are fill-in-the-blank phrases. They may also be steps in a process, items that all belong to the same category, synonyms or homophones,” The New York Times notes. “Just as she varies the difficulty of Wordle puzzles within a week, [Wordle and Strands editor Tracy] Bennett plans to throw Strands solvers curveballs every once in a while.”

I wasn't seeing anything immediately that fit the clue, so I went looking for words to earn a hint. I found SPEED on the bottom left, then TALL and DIAL in the center left. The hint highlighted ENVY in the bottom right. I figured right away that we were looking for the seven deadly sins.
That led me to getting SLOTH in the top right and LUST in the top left. PRIDE on the left rail was next, then GREED below that. Though I'd already spotted SINS at the bottom, I was missing the rest of the spangram until this point, when I figured out that it was CARDINAL SINS. That left me with WRATH in the middle and GLUTTONY on the right for the win. Overall, I used one clue and the spangram was the sixth theme word I found.
That’s all there is to it for today’s Strands clues and answers. Be sure to check my blog for hints and the solution for Friday’s game if you need them."
40fa184e-4952-4e41-8afc-4f22bcf1a61c,Indiana Pacers Approaching James Johnson Contract Guarantee Deadline,"Indiana Pacers forward James Johnson, left, drives against Atlanta Hawks forward Bruno Fernando ... [+] during the second half of an NBA basketball game in Indianapolis, Friday, Jan. 5, 2024. (AP Photo/Doug McSchooler) Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved
The Indiana Pacers have a transactional deadline coming up involving forward James Johnson that will force the front office to make a roster decision.
This coming week, all NBA contracts become fully guaranteed for the rest of the season. If a player is under contract come January 10, their salary is guaranteed to them for the remainder of the campaign. If a player is waived on a deal that isn’t fully guaranteed, their former team is off the hook for the non-guaranteed finances in the agreement.
Indiana only has one player who is currently on a non-guaranteed contract — forward James Johnson, who the team signed to a minimum deal just a few weeks ago. Johnson is in his second year with the Pacers and is a valuable locker room presence.
“He just has great wisdom in the locker room. He has great respect from all the guys,” Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle said of Johnson earlier this week. “He has a very good way of communicating to guys, particularly in the heat of the moment in games.”
More than 30 players around the NBA have non- or partially-guaranteed deals right now, so multiple teams will be faced with the same decision as Indiana. The blue and gold need to decide what the best course of action is with their veteran forward, and they have until 5 p.m. Eastern Time tomorrow to make the call.
That deadline is actually a few days in advance of January 10 because of the waiver process. It takes 48 hours for a player to clear waivers, and they must make it through that prior to January 10 for their contract to not become guaranteed. The Portland Trail Blazers already acted on these decisions by moving on from Skylar Mays and Ish Wainright.
In the next 30 or so hours, Johnson’s fate will be known. So far, he is averaging 1.0 points, 1.0 rebounds, and 1.3 assists per game in four appearances during the ongoing campaign.
On the hardwood, Johnson mostly plays during garbage time. He still has some ability, though, and threw down his first dunk of the season last night. But almost all of his value comes in the locker room and off the court. He’s a vital veteran piece to the franchise, which is why he was brought back in the first place.
“I know he’s on the older side, but he’s still got it,” Pacers guard T.J. McConnell said of Johnson this week. “In his short time here this year, he’s been phenomenal. I’m really glad he’s back.”
Clearly, the franchise values the presence of the 15-year veteran. Last season, they kept him through this exact deadline and guaranteed his contract. To facilitate a trade, though, they waived the 36-year old only to bring him back as soon as possible afterwards. Indiana was willing to pay Johnson two different guaranteed deals last year, which is perhaps the best way to show how much the franchise values him.

This year, the decision to keep Johnson or move on comes down to flexibility. Should the Pacers opt to waive the forward, they would carry a cap hit of just over $250k for the services Johnson provided from mid-December until now. But they would save about $1.2 million toward their salary cap figure, which could be valuable in trades or additions. They would also open a roster spot.
Those savings and options are valuable. And as of Friday, NBA teams can sign free agents to 10-day contracts, another useful tool when it comes to optionality. But the Pacers have to choose if those benefits and options are more valuable than simply having Johnson on their roster. Clearly, he gives them toughness and insight that is hard to find elsewhere.
Indiana could opt to waive Johnson, then sign him to a few 10-day deals and sort out his future with the franchise after the trade deadline. That would, in theory, be the path forward that maximizes flexibility and money.
But are those savings actually worth it? Indiana would lose Johnson’s services for a week-plus between now and the trade deadline in doing so, and it’s hard to imagine a better use of a roster spot for the young team than the veteran. He is important to their operation.
The financial savings are the larger benefit, but given that Indiana already has enough cap space to execute imbalanced trades or make signings, that may not be enough incentive to move on from the experienced forward. The Pacers are in a similar position to last season, and they kept Johnson then. If they need trade flexibility, they could simply waive the 2009 first-round pick again.
20 different teams have to make a decision based on the contract guarantee deadline coming this weekend. The Indiana Pacers are one of them. James Johnson has a minimum contract that wasn’t inked until two months into the season, so their decision has fewer consequences than some others around the league. But the Pacers will still have to make a choice in the next day or so about their veteran."

[+] Josh Giddey #3 of the Oklahoma City Thunder during the second quarter at Paycom Center. (Photo by Ian Maule/Getty Images) Getty Images
The signings, trades and acquisitions that organizations make during the offseason are usually the biggest factors in how well a team performs over the course of the regular season. Oftentimes the development of players already on the roster can play a large role and be what ultimately leads to different decisions being made by the front office.
This season will allow for players that were on the fringes of the rotation to lock down solidified roles moving forward. It will give the role players a chance to become starters and maybe even for a young starter to make a leap into the All-Star conversation. Here is a list of a couple of players from the Western Conference that are in line to make a leap.
Trey Murphy III
The 23-year-old took a massive jump in his second NBA season. He doubled his 3-point attempts, improved his shooting percentage and nearly tripled his scoring average from his rookie season. He received a 1st place vote in the “Most Improved Player” award and missed a total of only three games during the regular season.
The core of the New Orleans Pelicans has been viewed as Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson. After the Portland Trail Blazers trade last year in which they received CJ McCollum a case could be made that it is now a “big three” when they all share the court together. Murphy has butted into the conversation of not only being an integral part of the team, but a possible future star wing.
His shooting is an absolute necessity for breathing life into the Pelicans’ offense. McCollum and Murphy are the guards that help juice up the spacing for the offense as Ingram is willing to let it fly from deep, but typically likes to do his work in the mid-range. Williamson is one of the best players in the NBA at dominating inside, but it’s important for the team to have enough spacing to keep defenders from camping out inside the paint against him.
Last season, Murphy took over six 3-pointers per game and cashed in 40.6 percent of the shots. He was one of only 11 players in the NBA to take that many attempts per game while hitting more than 40 percent of the looks. That level of 3-point shooting is lethal and is aided by the fact that he doesn’t need the ball much. His usage rating during the year was a mere 14.3 percent, which sort of pigeon holes him as a gravity spacing shooter that can turn it loose from deep. Still, he was able to hit nearly 75 percent of his shots at the rim which is an incredibly strong number for a wing at his volume. It’s an area he may continue exploring heading into his third season after averaging 20 points per game during the final 20 games of the regular season.
His defense has had moments of being exceptional. His block and steal rates are both well above average for his position and the 6 '10 frame allows him to pester the opposition around the perimeter. The on-off splits don’t paint a kind picture of his defense since the team was 3.8 points per 100 possessions worse with him on that side of the ball. Other advanced metrics grade him out as more average so it’ll be important for him to continue maturing on that end in order to maximize his potential, especially since he projects as a starter in a lineup that has few defensive anchors.
Josh Giddey
Giddey has been a wonky player that is so easy to be excited about, but is easy to be skeptical of because of his warts. At only 20 years old it looks like the sky might be the limit for the Australian.
Right off the bat it’s easy to fall in love with his passing. His game is so aesthetically pleasing that you feel a lightness and control that is very atypical from a player so young. He ranked in the top-10 in the NBA in passes made per game, which is impressive when you consider that he isn’t the only facilitator on the team. His constant churning of the ball helps give the Thunder some crisp pacing that makes them hard to guard.
His assist to usage rating is one of the best in the league, and it’s not because he isn’t willing to shoot. The young guard took more than 14 shots per game last year, but still prioritized getting the ball to his teammates. The efficiency was a bit low— he has continued to struggle at being able to drive some type of cohesiveness to his shot chart diet. The one area in which he has excelled is in the short mid range with his 6’8 height. Being able to improve upon his 51.7 effective field goal percentage by being more successful at the rim will be extremely important for him to be able to reach the next level.
His outside shooting might always be a bit of a weakness in his game. The statistics show that he’s made improvements on the deep ball (he went up nearly seven percentage points last season), but the slow and low release don’t indicate an above average shooter. The difference maker for Giddey will be on defense and his shooting at the rim.
He is an excellent rebounder on both sides of the ball, but continues to struggle to make an impact on defense. Defensive RAPTOR rates him as one of the worst defensive players in the league and his block/steal rates are both well below average.
Thunder head coach Mark Daigneault and his scheme can help cover up those issues, but it’s an area he’ll need to improve as he looks to take the next step in his career."
3c93eb9b-01d7-4a55-bdd6-5edc4a6e2d46,Robert Atkins sentenced to life without parole in 1991 murder of Joy Hibbs,"BRISTOL, Pa. (AP) — Just one day after he was convicted of killing a Pennsylvania woman more than three decades ago, Robert Atkins was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.
Atkins, 57, was sentenced on Friday, Feb. 2 in Bucks County Court after being convicted a day earlier of first-degree murder and two counts of arson in the April 1991 death of 35-year-old Joy Hibbs in Bristol Township.
Authorities said the victim's body was found after a fire at a Bristol Township home, and an autopsy later concluded that she had been stabbed and strangled. Prosecutors alleged that a dispute over a marijuana sale escalated when Atkins threatened to kill Hibbs and blow up her house, and authorities had said the fire was set to cover up the murder. Atkins was arrested in the case in May 2022.
Defense attorney Craig Penglase argued that the case was built on a ""mountain of doubt"" following pressure from Hibbs' family and media reports on the case. He accused detectives in the initial investigation of mishandling evidence and failing to pursue other potential suspects.
Before sentencing, Judge Wallace H. Bateman Jr. said that Atkins had robbed Hibbs' family of a future with her.
""The depraved level of violence is almost unimaginable,"" he said. ""They were living the American dream. You didn't just take her life, you took that from them.""
Atkins was sentenced to the mandatory life-without-parole term in the murder conviction, an additional five to seven years on one arson conviction, and a 10- to 20-year concurrent term on the other arson conviction, prosecutors said.
Outside of the courtroom, David Hibbs, Joy Hibbs' youngest child, told The Philadelphia Inquirer that the family had begun to heal after three decades of fighting to solve his mother's case.
""We're sorry that it took 32 years to get here, but we finally got justice for Joy,"" he said."

e0b9ccc8-61b3-42a9-9d4a-05111139eea3,Church of England Blesses Same-Sex Couples For the First Time,"LONDON (AP) – Church of England priests offered officially sanctioned blessings of same-sex partnerships for the first time on Sunday, though a ban on church weddings for gay couples remains in place amid deep divisions within global Anglicanism over marriage and sexuality.
In one of the first ceremonies, the Rev. Catherine Bond and the Rev. Jane Pearce had their union blessed at St John the Baptist church, in Felixstowe, eastern England, where both are associate priests.
The couple knelt in front of Canon Andrew Dotchin, who held their heads as he gave “thanks for Catherine and Jane, to the love and friendship they share, and their commitment to one another as they come before you on this day.”
The church´s national assembly voted in February to allow clergy to bless the unions of same-sex couples who have had civil weddings or partnerships. The words used for the blessings, known as prayers of love and faith, were approved by the church´s House of Bishops on Tuesday and used for the first time on Sunday.
The compromise was struck following five years of discussions about the church´s position on sexuality. Church leaders offered an apology for the church´s failure to welcome LGBTQ people, but also endorsed the doctrine that marriage is the union of one man and one woman. Clergy won´t be required to perform same-sex blessings if they disagree with them.
The blessings can be used in regular church services. The church´s governing body has also drawn up a plan for separate “services of prayer and dedication” for same-sex couples that would resemble weddings, but it has not yet been formally approved.
Public opinion surveys consistently show that a majority of people in England support same-sex marriage, which has been legal since 2013. The church didn´t alter its teaching on marriage when the law changed.
Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has said he won´t personally bless any same-sex couples because it´s his job to unify the world’s 85 million Anglicans. Welby is the spiritual leader of both the Church of England and the global Anglican Communion of which it is a member.
Several Anglican bishops from Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Pacific said after the February decision that they no longer recognize Welby as their leader."

It's set up on Fort Armistead Road, near where the bridge's west end used to be.
The memorial was put up on Sunday.
A memorial for the #KeyBridgeCollapse victims was set up over the weekend on Fort Armistead Rd. Just met the artist, who says he plans to add onto what's already here.
There's a cross for each victim, a hard hat, and flag of their home country. Well meet the artist at 5. @wjz pic.twitter.com/hBqJh33qf2 — Dennis Valera (@dennisreports) April 1, 2024
There are six crosses adorned with hard hats to symbolize the six construction workers who were presumed dead after a cargo ship crashed into the bridge -- Miguel Luna, Maynor Yassir Suavo Sandoval, Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes, Dorlian Ronial Castillo Cabrera, Jose Lopez, and another unidentified man.
Also on the crosses are flags of each of the men's birth countries. There's even a mural being painted as well.
Artist and activist Robert Marquez drove to Baltimore from Dallas, Texas, wanting to create something to honor the victims.
""We want to send a message to the community, especially the family of the people that are trapped in the bridge, that they have people behind them and supporting them,"" Marquez said.
He worked with the group Los Yonkes to create the memorial.
Mirna Machado's parents happened to be driving by when the memorial was being set up, so that's when they called her to help pitch in.
Machado's parents immigrated to Maryland from El Salvador, where Luna immigrated from.
""[Immigrants are] the ones who built this nation and are supporting the whole nation. Immigrants do matter,"" Machado said.
So far, only Fuentes' and Cabrera's bodies have been pulled from the Patapsco River.
Since the collapse, the victims have been remembered as brothers, sons, and even as community leaders.

A big-deal ceramics conference is having its annual event in Richmond this year, running now through Saturday. Why it matters: The whole town will be alight with pottery-themed events connected to the event.
Zoom in: The National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts conference brings ceramics artists from across the globe for seminars, demonstrations and exhibitions.
The conference primarily takes place at the Richmond Convention Center, but affiliated events will be popping up all over town, including:
A multicultural fellowship exhibition dedicated to how artists express various cultural influences through clay — on view through August at the Black History Museum.
A talk about the history of ceramics in the African American South and how it influences contemporary art by VMFA curator Valerie Cassel Oliver. Saturday at the Convention Center.
A juried student exhibition at VisArts, opening Friday and on display through Sunday. (Check out the Bizarre Market Pop-Up while you're there.
If you go: Times and prices vary for each event; some are free; tickets to the events in the convention center start at $55.
And don't miss Clay Windows of Richmond — the most Richmond way to celebrate this pottery-themed weekend."

81919fb8-55e9-4b5a-a490-cb159dca303a,Should the next House speaker work across the aisle? Be loyal to Trump?,"The American public wants a House speaker who will work across the aisle and try to cut spending, but who won't try to either shut down the government or impeach Joe Biden. And many outside the GOP want the next speaker to be one who'll ""stand up to MAGA.""
But it's not clear the public will get all that, of course. Most Republicans, whose party essentially gets to choose, want a speaker who will try to impeach Biden and one who'll be loyal to Donald Trump.
Plus, the ""MAGA"" Republicans who comprise a sizable part of the GOP have a different wishlist: they want a speaker who is of their ""MAGA"" movement and don't want someone who'll compromise with Democrats, which sets them apart within their party, too.
Half the Republican rank-and-file want a new speaker who aligns with ""MAGA"" — and that desire rises to 85% among Republicans who consider themselves part of that movement. (Which four in 10 do.)
And most rank-and-file Republicans want a new speaker specifically loyal to Donald Trump — a desire that is much greater among ""MAGA"" movement Republicans.
Then, three-quarters of the nation's Republicans want the next speaker to try to impeach Joe Biden — and that sets them dramatically apart from non-Republicans, who are far less likely to want that.
That's looking forward. But last week's events divided the Republican rank-and-file, too, between those approving of Kevin McCarthy's ouster because they believed him ineffective, and because they thought he worked with Democrats — set opposite those Republicans who disapproved of the ouster, often because they think this will now disrupt Washington.
Overall, McCarthy's removal does find majority approval across party lines, with that perceived ineffectiveness as a common complaint among them. That said, partisans might have very different ideas of what constitutes being effective. Democrats, for their part, thought he paid too much attention to ""MAGA.""
For those Republicans approving, it was mainly about a perception that McCarthy was not effective, along with many wanting to punish him for working across the aisle.
Meanwhile for Republicans who disapprove of the removal, there's some appreciation for preventing a government shutdown as well as concern that this will now disrupt Washington.
Will it all matter, though? Although people do voice worry about it all, they don't immediately see implications for the country either way. Perhaps that's tied up in those feelings of ineffectiveness, or waiting to see what happens next, or maybe a just reflection on the long-standing negativity toward the parties more generally.
Neither party elicits positive views; something that has been the case for years, in part because partisans have such highly unfavorable views of the opposing party and independents view both parties unfavorably. Favorable views of the Republican Party generally are just below those of the Democrats.

Policymakers are bracing for a hit to their economies as China’s imports of everything from construction materials to electronics slide. Caterpillar Inc. says Chinese demand for machines used on building sites is worse than previously thought. U.S. President Joe Biden called the economic problems a “ticking time bomb.”
Global investors have already pulled more than $10 billion from China’s stock markets, with most of the selling in blue chips. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley have cut their targets for Chinese equities, with the former also warning of spillover risks to the rest of the region.
Read More: China Says Its Focus for 2023 Is the Economy. But It’s Not Clear Politics Can Be Put Aside
Asian economies are taking the biggest hit to their trade so far, along with countries in Africa. Japan reported its first drop in exports in more than two years in July after China cut back on purchases of cars and chips. Central bankers from South Korea and Thailand last week cited China’s weak recovery for downgrades to their growth forecasts.
It’s not all doom-and-gloom, though. China’s slowdown will drag down global oil prices, and deflation in the country means the prices of goods being shipped around the world are falling. That’s a benefit to countries like the U.S. and U.K. still battling high inflation.
Some emerging markets like India also see opportunities, hoping to attract the foreign investment that may be leaving China’s shores.
Read More: China Appears to Choose National Security Over Foreign Investment
But as the world’s second-largest economy, a prolonged slowdown in China will hurt, rather than help, the rest of the world. An analysis from the International Monetary Fund shows how much is at stake: when China’s growth rate rises by 1 percentage point, global expansion is boosted by about 0.3 percentage points.
China’s deflation “isn’t such a bad thing” for the global economy, Peter Berezin, chief global strategist BCA Research Inc., said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “But, if the rest of the world, the U.S. and Europe, falls into recession, if China remains weak, then that would be a problem — not just for China but for the whole global economy.”
Here’s a look at how China’s slowdown is rippling across economies and financial markets.
Trade slump
Many countries, especially those in Asia, count China as their biggest export market for everything from electronic parts and food to metals and energy.
The value of Chinese imports has fallen for nine of the last 10 months as demand retreats from the record highs set during the pandemic. The value of shipments from Africa, Asia and North America were all lower in July than they were a year ago.
Africa and Asia have been the hardest hit, with the value of imports down more than 14% in the first seven months this year. Part of that is due to a drop in demand for electronics parts from South Korea and Taiwan, while falling prices of commodities such as fossil fuels are also hitting the value of goods shipped to China.
Read More: How China’s Faltering Growth Threatens Global Commodities Markets
So far, the actual volume of commodities such as iron or copper ore sent to China has held up. But if the slowdown continues, shipments could be impacted, which would affect miners in Australia, South America and elsewhere around the world.
Deflation pressure
Producer prices in China have contracted for the past 10 months, meaning the cost of goods being shipped from the country is falling. That’s welcome news for people around the globe still struggling with high inflation.
The price of Chinese goods at U.S. docks has fallen every month this year and that is likely to continue until factory prices in China return to positive territory. Economists at Wells Fargo & Co. estimate that a ‘hard landing’ in China — which they define as a 12.5% divergence from its trend growth — would cut the baseline forecast for US consumer inflation in 2025 by 0.7 percentage points to 1.4%.
Slow tourism rebound
Chinese consumers are spending more on services, like travel and tourism, than on goods — but they’re not yet venturing overseas in large numbers. Until recently the government had banned group tours to many countries and there is still a lack of flights, meaning it’s much more expensive to travel than it was before the pandemic.
Read More: China’s Tourists Can Travel Again. Here’s Why the World Is Still Waiting for the Rebound
The pandemic and weak economy have curbed incomes in China, while the years-long housing market slump means homeowners feel less wealthy than before. That suggests it may take a long time for overseas travel to rebound to the levels they were at before the pandemic, hitting tourism-dependent nations in Southeast Asia such as Thailand.
Currency impact
China’s economic woes have pushed the currency down more than 5% against the dollar this year, with the yuan close to breaching the 7.3 mark this month. The central bank has escalated its defense of the yuan through various measures including its daily currency fixings.
The depreciation in the offshore yuan is having a greater impact on its peers in Asia, Latin America and the Central and Eastern Europe bloc, Bloomberg data show, with the correlation of the Chinese currency to some others rising.
Read More: How China Is Trying to Lift Its Slumping Economy
The weak sentiment spillover may weigh on currencies like the Singapore dollar, Thai baht, and Mexican peso as correlations rise, according to Barclays Bank Plc.
“With the weaker China economy it’s very difficult to be optimistic on the Asian economies and currencies and we’re more concerned about the metal-exposed currencies,” said Magdalena Polan, head of emerging market macro research at PGIM Ltd. Weakness in the construction sector may see currencies of commodity-led economies, such as the Chilean peso and South African rand, suffer, she said.
The Australian dollar, which often trades as a proxy for China, has lost more than 3% this quarter, the worst performer in the Group-of-10 basket.
Bonds lose appeal
China’s interest rate cuts this year have reduced the appeal of its bonds to foreign investors, who have cut their exposure to the market and are looking for alternatives in the rest of the region.
Overseas holdings of Chinese sovereign notes are at the lowest share of the total market since 2019, according to Bloomberg calculations. Global funds had turned more bullish on the local currency bonds of South Korea and Indonesia as central banks there near the end of their interest-rate hiking cycles.
Luxury stocks
Companies from Nike Inc. to Caterpillar have reported a hit to their earnings from China’s slowdown. An MSCI index that tracks global companies with the biggest exposure to China has retreated 9.3% this month, nearly double the decline in the broader gauge of world stocks.

A gauge of European luxury goods and Thailand travel and leisure also track losses to China’s onshore equity benchmark. The sectors are “accurate reflections of how global investors may take indirect exposure to China and the outlook as China’s economy continues to weigh,” said Redmond Wong, a market strategist at Saxo Capital Markets in Hong Kong.
Luxury goods firms such as Louis Vuitton bags-maker LVMH, Gucci-owner Kering SA and Hermes International are particularly vulnerable to any wobbles in Chinese demand.

Former President Donald Trump’s hush money trial, which commenced Monday in Manhattan with jury selection, could cost him the 2024 election if it ends in a conviction, polls show—even though less than half of voters believe he should be found guilty.

Key Facts
A New York Times/Siena poll released Saturday, the latest to ask about the case, found 57% of registered voters polled believe the charges are serious, while 37% said they weren’t serious, and 46% said he should be found guilty, while 37% said he shouldn’t and 17% weren’t sure or refused the question. Polls show a guilty conviction in any of Trump’s four criminal cases—even in the lower-profile hush money case—could sway the results of the November election, as Trump and President Joe Biden are within single-digit margins of each other and the race will likely be decided by a handful of swing states that Biden won by just tens of thousands of votes in 2020. Some 13% of voters who said they would vote for Trump today indicated they wouldn’t if he were convicted of a felony, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week that also found 24% of all Republicans surveyed wouldn’t vote for Trump if he were convicted of a felony—which could be enough to cost Trump the election. Voters are split along party lines: Just 14% of Republicans think Trump is guilty in the case, which accuses him of falsifying records to hide hush money payments, compared to 86% of Democrats and 54% of independents, according to a March Politico/Ipsos poll. The Reuters/Ispos poll also found the majority of adults consider each of Trump’s criminal cases to be “serious,” though less so when it comes to the hush money case, which 65% said was serious, compared to his federal classified documents case (70%), his Georgia election interference case (72%) and the federal election fraud case (75%). Some 38% of voters believe Trump’s conduct in the hush money case was unethical but not illegal, according to an August AP/NORC survey that found 13% said the same about his Georgia election interference case, 18% for his role in the January 6 Capitol riots and 16% for his federal classified documents case. The Reuters/Ipsos poll suggests Trump’s claims that his four criminal cases are designed to thwart his chances of being elected appear to be resonating with many voters, 48% of whom said the charges are “excessive and politically motivated,” with 78% of Republicans, 16% of Democrats and 50% of Independents sharing that view.
Big Number
0.2 percentage points. That’s Trump’s lead against Biden in a general election matchup, according to RealClearPolitics’ polling average.
Key Background
Jury selection for Trump’s hush money trial—the first of his four criminal cases—started Monday in Manhattan, where he faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Prosecutors allege Trump’s company paid his former attorney Michael Cohen $420,000 as reimbursement for payments Cohen made to adult film star Stormy Daniels in exchange for her silence about an affair she claims to have had with Trump. Prosecutors elevated the falsifying business records charges, typically a misdemeanor, to felonies by alleging Trump committed the alleged crimes in the commission of the secondary crime of campaign finance violations, arguing the payments were effectively political donations to Trump that exceeded the legal limit. Trump has pleaded not guilty to the charges and has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that state Judge Juan Merchan and the prosecutor who brought the case, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, are working on behalf of Biden to help him win the election.
What To Watch For
It could take at least a week to select the 12-person jury. Jurors will be asked a series of 42 questions to determine if they are capable of serving in an impartial manner, including whether they have attended a Trump rally or follow him on social media.
What We Don’t Know
Whether Merchan will grant prosecutors’ request to have Trump fined $3,000 on grounds he violated the terms of the gag order he imposed in March that prohibits Trump from disparaging potential witnesses, court staff or their families and family members of Merchan and Bragg. Prosecutors pointed to Trump’s attacks on Cohen and Daniels in a series of Truth Social posts over the weekend in making the request Monday. Merchan will hold a hearing April 23 to determine whether Trump violated the order.

6c86e84b-8513-405e-9d1b-a0a3c41f437b,Presidents Day: 5 Presidents Who Warned Against Mass Immigration,"While presidents have long had disagreements on national policy, many agreed that unchecked immigration to the United States ultimately hurts Americans and those legal immigrants who have already arrived.
Five presidents, in particular, have famously warned against mass immigration to the United States — despite their differences on a variety of other issues.
Calvin Coolidge
In the early 1920s, President Calvin Coolidge (R) drastically reduced annual legal immigration levels to the United States, stabilizing the nation’s population following decades of record-high immigration.
Coolidge, in a December 1923 address, said immigration levels must not exceed the ability of Americans to absorb new arrivals and that “America must be kept American.”
“American institutions rest solely on good citizenship. They were created by people who had a background of self-government,” Coolidge said:
New arrivals should be limited to our capacity to absorb them into the ranks of good citizenship. America must be kept American. For this I [sic] purpose, it is necessary to continue a policy of restricted immigration. It would be well to make such immigration of a selective nature with some inspection at the source, and based either on a prior census or upon the record of naturalization. Either method would insure the admission of those with the largest capacity and best intention of becoming citizens. I am convinced that our present economic and social conditions warrant a limitation of those to be admitted. We should find additional safety in a law requiring the immediate registration of all aliens. Those who do not want to be partakers of the American spirit ought not to settle in America.
Bill Clinton
Democrat and Republican lawmakers applauded when President Bill Clinton (D), in his 1995 State of the Union address, blasted mass immigration to the United States as a detriment to American citizens who are forced to pick up the tab.
“All Americans … are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. The jobs they hold may otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public services they use impose burdens on our taxpayers,” Clinton said.
Taking a step even further, in June 1995, Clinton proudly endorsed the recommendations made by the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, which was chaired by civil rights icon then-Rep. Barbara Jordan (D-TX).
The commission recommended cutting legal immigration levels in half, admitting about half a million immigrants annually, while carrying out an aggressive assimilation process for new arrivals and driving up deportations of illegal aliens.
Theodore Roosevelt
President Theodore Roosevelt (R) laid out his vision for controlling immigration to the United States in an April 1894 essay titled “True Americanism” in which he argued that assimilation is vital to the foundation of American principles.
Roosevelt wrote:
The mighty tide of immigration to our shores has brought in its train much of good and much of evil; and whether the good or the evil shall predominate depends mainly on whether these newcomers do or do not throw themselves heartily into our national life, cease to be Europeans, and become Americans like the rest of us. More than a third of the people of the Northern States are of foreign birth or parentage. An immense number of them have become completely Americanized, and these stand on exactly the same plane as the descendants of any Puritan, Cavalier, or Knickerbocker among us, and do their full and honorable share of the nation’s work. But where immigrants, or the sons of immigrants, do not heartily and in good faith throw in their lot with us, but cling to the speech, the customs, the ways of life, and the habits of thought of the Old World which they have left, they thereby harm both themselves and us. If they remain alien elements, unassimilated, and with interests separate from ours, they are mere obstructions to the current of our national life, and, moreover, can get no good from it themselves. In fact, though we ourselves also suffer from their perversity, it is they who really suffer most. It is an immense benefit to the European immigrant to change him into an American citizen. To bear the name of American is to bear the most honorable titles; and whoever does not so believe has no business to bear the name at all, and, if he comes from Europe, the sooner he goes back there the better.
Barack Obama
In his 2006 book “Audacity of Hope,” then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) — who would later win the 2008 presidential election — said illegal and legal immigration must be controlled to not lower the wages of America’s working and lower-middle class.
“The number of immigrants added to the labor force every year is of a magnitude not seen in this country for over a century,” Obama noted in the book, going on to write, “If this huge influx of mostly low-skill [sic] workers provides some benefits to the economy … it also threatens to depress further the wages of blue-collar Americans [and] puts strains on an already overburdened safety net.
""The number of immigrants added to the labor force every year is of a magnitude not seen in this country for over a century.""
— Barack Obama, The Audacity of Hope pic.twitter.com/R10Np1r2m1 — NumbersUSA (@NumbersUSA) August 30, 2020
Donald Trump
Perhaps most defined by immigration policy, President Donald Trump (R) successfully campaigned in the 2016 presidential election on immigration moratoriums, increased deportations of illegal aliens, building a border wall, abolishment of work visa programs to shore up jobs for Americans, and championed the plight of Angel Families.
In August 2016, Trump issued an address on immigration in Phoenix, Arizona which has helped define the Republican Party.
“The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists, and powerful politicians,” Trump said:
Let me tell you who it does not serve. It does not serve you the American people. Doesn’t serve you. When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, lower wages. Immigration reform should mean something else entirely. It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens. If we’re going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues. For instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people, our forgotten working people, have over the record pace of immigration and its impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills and general living conditions. These are valid concerns expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds, all over. We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. Sometimes it’s just not going to work out. It’s our right, as a sovereign nation, to chose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us.

The project, Worldcoin, aims to distribute a crypto token to people ""just for being a unique individual"". The project uses a device to scan irises to confirm their identity, after which they are given the tokens for free.
Worldcoin has faced criticism for perceived privacy risks. In response to Altman's tweet introducing the project in 2021, former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden tweeted, ""Don't catalogue eyeballs"".
The token will not be available to people in the United States and some other countries, according to Worldcoin's website.
The digital asset space is looking to regain popularity after a bruising 2022 that saw several crypto ventures collapse, including the spectacular implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX.
Investors including a16z crypto, Bain Capital Crypto and Distributed Global also participated in Worldcoin's latest fundraise.
Altman and OpenAI, the startup behind ChatGPT, have been in the spotlight since late last year, with interest in artificial intelligence growing by leaps and bounds. He testified before a U.S. Senate panel last week and called for regulation of the technology.

Driving the news: The Justice Department ""is nearing a decision"" on whether to challenge Thoma Bravo's proposed $2.3 billion take-private buyout of identity management firm ForgeRock, per Politico.
Why it matters: Neither DOJ nor the FTC have ever sued to block a private equity transaction of this size, instead playing around the edges by focusing on things like partners sitting on multiple board seats within the same industry.
In fact, the most significant U.S. antitrust action in recent memory on a PE deal came last year when the FTC forced a JAB Investors portfolio company to divest 16 veterinary clinics it acquired via a $1.1 billion bolt-on.
Theory of the case: Private equity typically avoids antitrust scrutiny because each of a fund's portfolio companies typically operate independently of one another.
DOJ, however, believes that Thoma Bravo may seek to merge ForgeRock with existing portfolio company Ping Identity — and maybe even with a third portfolio company called SailPoint.
Thoma Bravo itself hasn't said it plans to merge portfolio companies, at least not publicly, but it also hasn't said it won't merge them — the latter of which seems telling. A spokesperson declined further comment.
Earlier this year, the FT reported that Thoma Bravo lost out on Qualtrics because of fears that a subsequent portfolio merger would run into antitrust opposition.
🧠 Thought bubble, from Axios Codebook author Sam Sabin: ""The identity management space is, understandably, saturated with Google, Microsoft, 1Password and others competing for business. The only concern for regulators could be that ForgeRock and Ping seemingly go after the same customer markets, but it's unclear if that's enough to support an antitrust probe.""
The bottom line: Investors seem a bit skeptical that the buyout will close, with ForgeRock shares closing Tuesday at a 14,3% discount to what Thoma Bravo agreed to pay."

""This is why it's urgent for us to sort of address vaccination so that we can really decelerate sort of the march of measles, given the global scenario as well as what we're seeing with some vaccination rates in the country,"" said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.
Friday's tally of measles cases is up from 45 counted by the CDC last week. Additional infections have since been announced in Arizona, California, Illinois and Ohio.
While infections have climbed, Daskalakis said counts still remain small enough to make it difficult for officials to navigate privacy concerns in releasing additional demographic trends of cases so far. Investigations are also still ongoing to collect that information.
Daskalakis said the majority of cases so far have been linked to unvaccinated Americans returning to the U.S. with the virus.
""Measles is a easily preventable disease with a readily available and safe vaccine. And so, as we are seeing more cases in the U.S., we have the technology and the ability to be able to prevent measles,"" he said.
The CDC updated its guidance Wednesday to counsel Americans who are unsure if they're up to date on their shots to seek out a doctor at least six weeks before their trip.
Here's what we know about the outbreaks so far this year.
Which states have reported the largest measles outbreaks in 2024?
So far this year, 17 states – Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington – have reported at least one case.
Illinois has reported the most measles cases in recent weeks, with 12 total infections reported in Chicago. Of them, 10 were residents at a migrant shelter. Two cases are not related to the shelter outbreak, a spokesperson for the city's health department said.
The CDC deployed a team to Chicago on March 12 to work with the city to investigate and curb the spread of the virus, and support the city's vaccination campaign.
Daskalakis praised the Chicago team responding to the cases. The city was the first to invite CDC to help in a measles outbreak response so far this year.
He said the agency would likely gather lessons learned from Chicago's response to help other cities too, citing his previous experience as a top-ranking health official in New York City during past large outbreaks there.
""I could see the lessons from the New York experience being built into this response. So the answer is yes, we always iterate and I'm sure we'll learn some things from Chicago that will be valuable in other settings as well,"" Daskalakis said.
Florida has reported the next most cases, with 10 infections so far this year. All but one of the cases was reported in Broward County, after a Miami-area elementary school reported an outbreak.
CDC laboratories were tapped to help in investigating the genotype of the virus behind that outbreak, which can aid in narrowing down leads for the outbreak's origin.
Most of the cases nationwide have been confirmed through laboratory testing. Two cases remain suspected, in Ohio's Clermont County and Arizona's Coconino County.
Why are measles cases on the rise in 2024?
Most outbreaks this year in the U.S. have been blamed on unvaccinated travelers bringing the virus back with them and exposing others who don't have immunity.
Measles is extremely contagious, and a person who has the infection can spread it for four days before developing symptoms. Symptoms often do not appear until 11 days after exposure.
At least six cases this year were in people who were first exposed to the virus abroad, according to CDC data updated Thursday. Last year ended with 13 of these ""imported"" cases reported, as of the agency's preliminary tally from the end of December.
Parents may not be aware that babies are recommended to get a vaccine for measles before international travel as early as six months old, officials have said, while older travelers may not realize that their destinations are facing outbreaks.
Cases have been on the rise around the world, blamed on a wide gap in immunity in many countries resulting from missed vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Records obtained by CBS News through a Freedom of Information Act request show the CDC had launched investigations of measles exposures through Feb. 20 in arriving international flights that departed from Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey.
Health officials in Georgia and California have also confirmed at least one of their cases this year was linked to travel through the Middle East. Other outbreaks in recent months have also been linked to travel in other parts of the world like Europe, which has also been facing a resurgence of infections.
""These fires are popping up all across the world, really creating the sparks that can kindle these small outbreaks in the U.S., with our goal of not letting that spark go beyond a small outbreak and kindle like a larger fire,"" said Daskalakis.
However, some recent clusters have also not been tied to international travel.
Louisiana's health department said their cases this year were exposed in another U.S. state. A spokesperson for Arizona's Coconino County said their recent cases had not been linked to recent international travel or the other cases reported previously in the state this year.
When was the last time the U.S. saw a surge of measles cases?
The most measles cases seen in the U.S. since the COVID-19 pandemic was in 2022, with 121 cases reported in just six states.
Many of the infections in 2022 resulted from low immunity among the thousands of evacuees airlifted from Afghanistan that year, prompting a mass vaccination campaign to curb further spread.
Before the pandemic, the last peak in infections came in 2019, when 1,274 measles cases were reported across 31 states.
This marked the largest number of measles infections on record nationwide since 1992, driven in part by outbreaks that continued for months among large, close-knit Orthodox Jewish communities in New York. Other countries around the world also saw major outbreaks that year.
At the time, federal health authorities worried the outbreaks could threaten the U.S. status of having eliminated the virus — a status it officially achieved in 2000.
But Daskalakis says at this point ""we are nowhere close to"" seeing measles elimination being threatened.
Losing measles elimination status requires months of sustained transmission of the virus in a community, Daskalakis said, which has yet to be seen.
""We're being, with our local and state health officials, being really persistent on the issue that we address these outbreaks, as well as the bigger picture of catch up vaccination. But I think that this is the time to act so we don't get anywhere close to losing our measles elimination,"" he said.
What are the symptoms of measles?
Around two weeks after first being exposed to someone else infected with measles, the earliest symptoms of the virus tend to be a high fever alongside at least one of what experts call ""the three C's"" of measles:
Cough Runny nose, which doctors call coryza Pink eye, which doctors call conjunctivitis
Daskalakis stressed that fever was a key part of the early signs of measles that set it apart from other causes of these common symptoms.
""We don't want every runny nose to say, I need to get tested for measles. It is allergy season, after all,"" he said.
A few days after that begins the distinctive rash caused by measles, which usually starts around the face before spreading to the upper body. Measles rashes are typically not itchy. Common complications include ear infections and diarrhea.
Tests are usually most sensitive to detecting measles infections when administered by a doctor at least three days after the rashes begin.
Health authorities say people worried they may be sick with measles should call ahead to their doctor or hospital before visiting, given precautions that providers need to take to avoid spreading the highly contagious virus to other patients.
What are the complications of measles?
The CDC says about 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who catch measles are hospitalized.
During 2019's record outbreak, 5% of the hospitalized patients had infections in their lungs, which doctors call pneumonia, and one developed encephalitis, or brain swelling. No deaths were reported.
Measles can be fatal, especially in young children. Before the disease was eliminated in the U.S., thanks to the widespread adoption of the vaccine in the 1960s, around two to three deaths occurred for every 1,000 cases reported.
The last U.S. death from measles was in 2015, a CDC spokesperson said. Daskalakis said that measles fatalities are rare in U.S. patients, but cautioned even mild cases can face longer-term issues.
""There's a pretty good body of evidence that measles itself can cause reduced immunity to other pathogens. So even if we are seeing folks who are having mild cases, there's other things that could be further downstream that worry me,"" he said."
10e67ef4-e6bb-4416-8cb2-2deb15eee9bf,Young couple killed by hit-and-run driver in Exposition Park; suspect arrested,"A young couple was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver early Sunday morning in Exposition Park and thanks to the help of witnesses to the incident, authorities were able to make an arrest.
The crash happened at around 12:40 a.m., when Los Angeles Fire Department crews were dispatched to 3998 S. Normandie Avenue near Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, where the speed limit is just 35 miles per hour.
They arrived to find two, a 21-year-old man and 20-year-old woman, people dead at the scene, according to Los Angeles Police Department.
The suspect, a man in his 30s, was said to have been speeding through the area while behind the wheel of a Jeep Wrangler Rubicon when he slammed into the white BMW that both victims were inside of after getting something to eat at the Burger Factory.
""Unfortunately, two young folks lost their lives this morning just doing something as simple as going to get food,"" said LAPD Detective Ryan Moreno, who said the suspect could have been driving as fast as double or triple the speed limit.
After the crash, witnesses told investigators that the suspect fled from the scene on foot, but witnesses to the crash followed, leading to his eventual arrest outside of his home in South LA.
""People came together, a lot of strangers did the right thing,"" Moreno said. ""Help us get where we are in this investigation. It was just great.""
They also believe that the suspect had been drinking prior to the crash, after finding evidence of alcohol inside of the wrecked vehicle."
4bfe4941-d2ce-4f2b-af42-841f23245772,Texas Rangers defeat Arizona Diamondbacks to claim first-ever World Series,"Nathan Eovaldi pitched six gutsy innings, Mitch Garver broke a scoreless tie with an RBI single in the seventh and the Texas Rangers are World Series champions for the first time in their 63-year franchise history after beating the Arizona Diamondbacks 5-0 in Game 5 on Wednesday night.
Marcus Semien homered late and the Rangers, held hitless for six innings by Zac Gallen, finished a record 11-0 on the road this postseason by capping the Fall Classic with three straight wins in the desert.
One night after Texas took a 10-run lead by the third in a Game 4 snoozer, it finished the Series by outlasting the Diamondbacks in a white-knuckle pitchers' duel through eight innings, piling on four runs in the ninth for good measure.

Gallen took a no-hitter into the seventh before giving up an opposite-field single to World Series MVP Corey Seager, whose weak grounder found a hole. Rangers rookie Evan Carter — all of 21 years old — followed with a double into the right-center gap. Garver then delivered the first run, pumping his fist as a hard-hit grounder got through the middle of the infield to score Seager and make it 1-0.
Garver was 1 for 17 at the plate in the World Series before his huge hit.
The Rangers tacked on four more runs in the ninth to break open the game. Semien's two-run homer off Paul Sewald made it 5-0. The outburst was typical of the Texas offense, which scored at least three runs in an inning 13 times this postseason.
Eovaldi pitched out of trouble all night before Aroldis Chapman and Josh Sborz finished it.
It's the first title for the Rangers, whose history dates back to 1961 when they were the expansion Washington Senators. They moved to Texas for the 1972 season and came agonizingly close to a World Series championship in 2011, needing just one strike on two occasions before eventually falling to the St. Louis Cardinals.
Now, after five stadiums, roughly two dozen managers and 10,033 games, the Rangers are champions.
""As a Texas Rangers fan, I am thrilled for Texas Rangers fans tonight,"" former President George W. Bush, who was a minority owner in the Rangers in the early 1990s, said in a statement late Wednesday night. ""I congratulate the owners, the managers and coaching staff, the front office, and the entire organization. And of course, I congratulate the players of this awesome team on winning the first World Series in our club's history. This was baseball at its finest, and Laura and I are proud of this team.""
It wasn't easy. Texas led the AL West for a big chunk of the season, but coughed up the division title on the final day of the regular season to rival Houston. The Rangers also weathered injuries to key pieces, particularly ace pitcher Jacob deGrom.
That loss in the regular-season finale at Seattle left the Rangers with the No. 5 seed in the AL playoffs and it sent them across the country to open the playoffs at Tampa Bay, part of two-week trip that took them to four cities — two on each coast. Then Texas got its revenge against Houston, winning a hard-fought series in seven games that brought them to the World Series.
Finally, the Rangers had to get past the Diamondbacks, who won just 84 games during the regular season but beat the Brewers, Dodgers and Phillies in a remarkable postseason run that finally fizzled.
Gallen was one of the best pitchers in the majors this season, starting for the National League in the All-Star game. But the 28-year-old hadn't been as sharp in the playoffs, with a 2-2 record and 5.27 ERA over five starts.
That changed on Wednesday. The bespectacled righty was at his best, mowing down the first 14 hitters he faced before walking Nathaniel Lowe. He got some help from his defense in the fourth — shortstop Geraldo Perdomo made a nice grab on a hard-hit grounder from Marcus Semien, and Christian Walker was there to snag the one-hop throw to first.
In the fifth, Lourdes Gurriel Jr. tracked down Josh Jung's shot into the left-center gap, catching it a few steps in front of the 413-foot sign.
Eovaldi wasn't quite as sharp, but still matched Gallen's zeros on the scoreboard despite walking five, which was his most in an outing since 2013.
The D-backs had some juicy opportunities to score in the first five innings, but couldn't convert, going 0 for 9 with runners in scoring position.
Eovaldi made it through six, giving up four hits and striking out five over 97 pitches."

Conservative firebrand Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) fanned the flames on Monday of his feud with Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) amid speculation over when Gaetz will pull the trigger on the motion to vacate.
Why it matters: After alerting the media that he would be delivering a floor speech, Gaetz indicated that the motion would be filed later this week while accusing McCarthy of striking a ""secret side deal on Ukraine"" with Democrats in exchange for their votes to pass a stopgap spending bill.
""Members of the Republican Party might vote differently on a motion to vacate if they heard what the speaker had to share with us about his secret side deal with Joe Biden on Ukraine,"" he said on the floor. ""I'll be listening —stay tuned.""
Gaetz has also hit the cable news circuit to make his case against McCarthy and repeatedly trolled him on social media.
One member likened the lead up to the expected motion to vacate to ""a cat playing with its mouse.""
A single member can trigger a motion to vacate vote, which requires a majority of the House to remove a speaker.
No speaker in history has been removed by such a motion.
The House last voted on a motion to vacate in 1910.
What they're saying: Conservative hardliners are fuming about McCarthy's decision to bring a clean continuing resolution to the floor, arguing that he broke the terms of their January agreement. McCarthy allies have argued that a small faction of the conference are sparking unnecessary chaos.
""Let's roll!"" Rep. Eli Crane (R-Ariz.) said of a motion to vacate.
""Gaetz is like an arsonist calling the fire department,"" one lawmaker told Axios, making the case that a motion to vacate makes accomplishing passing conservative bills more difficult.
The intrigue: McCarthy is expected to need Democrats to remain in his leadership position if Gaetz ultimately files the motion, and it remains unclear whether they will back him to make up the California Republicans' deficit within his own conference.
Talk among moderates to change the rules package to prevent constant efforts to oust McCarthy have been floated.
Conservatives have also voiced concerns over what concessions McCarthy would need to give Democrats for them to agree to take action to keep him in his leadership position.
The big picture: McCarthy's ability to retain his gavel is in its most perilous position since January, with lawmakers beginning to float potential alternatives."
78c10606-b89d-44e0-9f72-9755ef788ba4,"Native American tribe plans protests, considers suing Biden admin over oil-leasing crackdown","EXCLUSIVE: The president of the Navajo Nation told Fox News Digital that he has ordered the tribe's attorney general to weigh legal action following the Biden administration's oil-leasing ban impacting Navajo citizens.
Buu Nygren, the president of the Navajo Nation, a federally recognized tribe in the U.S. southwest, said that the Navajo Justice Department was considering pursuing litigation after Interior Secretary Deb Haaland's recent order, and he plans to protest her upcoming visit to the reservation on Sunday. Last week, Haaland banned oil, gas and mineral leasing within 10 miles of the Chaco Culture National Historical Park in northwestern New Mexico for 20 years, an action strongly opposed by nearby Navajo communities.
""To totally disregard those local communities — it's unfair,"" Nygren told Fox News Digital in an interview Saturday. ""There's no need to celebrate putting people into poverty, to celebrate undermining the Navajo Nation's sovereignty, undermining everything that comes into working with tribes, in this case, Navajo Nation.""
""I tasked the attorney general to look into all our options, because I want to be doing justice for the local community,"" he continued. ""As president, I've already told my attorney general to look into all the options. So, we're going to be moving forward with that as well.""
NATIVE AMERICAN LEADERS REBUKE BIDEN ADMIN OVER OIL LEASING BAN: 'UNDERMINES OUR SOVEREIGNTY'
Nygren and other Navajo leaders, in addition to locals, have argued that the Department of the Interior's (DOI) action banning leasing will harm low-income Navajo citizens who depend on revenue from leasing their allotments within ten miles of Chaco Canyon mainly to fossil fuel companies.
The allotments date back to the 1900s, when the federal government awarded them to Navajo citizens as a consolation when the tribe's territory was downsized.
""Since I've entered the legislative body for my Navajo people, I've listened to a lot of constituents out in that area and, you know, it's just emotional distress, psychologically as well, that they've talked about this — it really disturbs me to know how much more of a hardship that these folks are going to be experiencing out there,"" Brenda Jesus, who chairs the Navajo Nation Council's Resources & Development Committee, told Fox News Digital earlier this week.
REPUBLICANS RAISE ETHICS CONCERNS OVER BIDEN CABINET OFFICIAL WHO ORDERED OIL LEASING BAN
Jesus led a delegation of Navajo tribal leaders who met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week, making their case against the DOI's ban. Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyo., who chairs a House panel on Indian affairs, said the action represented a ""taking"" of tribal lands and vowed congressional action following her meeting with the delegation.
Overall, there are currently 53 Indian allotments located in the 10-mile buffer zone around Chaco Canyon, generating $6.2 million per year in royalties for an estimated 5,462 allottees, according to Navajo Nation data. In addition, there are 418 unleased allotments in the zone that are associated with 16,615 allottees.
According to the Western Energy Alliance, an industry group that represents oil and gas producers in the area, Navajo members will lose an estimated $194 million as a result of Haaland's actions.
""You can't pound your chest on going after people in poverty,"" Nygren told Fox News Digital. ""I don't know who would want to celebrate that. Personally, I think that's, I don't know, you got to not have a heart if you're going to put people that are already impoverished in third-world-country conditions and barely have enough to pay for gas, food, laundry, the daily necessities — to put them into an even tougher situation.""
""To me, I don't know how anybody could sleep with that thought,"" he said. ""Come to Navajo. It's tough. Everybody's struggling, everybody's trying to make a dollar, literally.""
BIDEN ADMIN HIT WITH LAWSUITS FOR HIDING COMMUNICATIONS INVOLVING CABINET SECRETARY’S DAUGHTER
Haaland is expected to visit Chaco Canyon on Sunday to celebrate the action. Nygren said that Navajo citizens are planning to peacefully protest the event and that he has even faced calls to block the interior secretary's access to Navajo roads.
""You shouldn't celebrate beating up people in poverty,"" Nygren said.
Nygren also noted that the Biden administration failed to offer any economic proposal to account for the income losses the Chaco land withdrawal would create for Navajo allottees.
In addition, Nygren criticized Haaland for not properly consulting the Navajo Nation and the communities near Chaco Canyon that would be most impacted by the action. The tribe previously endorsed a five-mile buffer zone to protect the site while ensuring future drilling on oil-rich allotments, but has said that Haaland never considered the compromise.

Disney has hired New Orleans native and musician extraordinaire PJ Morton to compose an original theme song for the new Princess Tiana ride that is being billed as a ""love letter to New Orleans.""
Why it matters: Disney is retheming the popular ""Splash Mountain"" rides in Disney World and Disneyland and converting them to ""Tiana's Bayou Adventure,"" which will feature the company's first Black princess from 2009's ""Princess and the Frog.""
This will be the second ride with New Orleans flair. Haunted Mansion, which is at both parks, is based on a New Orleans home.
Bayou Adventure is set to open at Disney World toward the end of 2024.
Zoom in: Executives said the goal is for Morton's song to be as iconic and catchy as the ""It's a Small World"" theme song. No details were released for the tune.
New Orleans native Terrance Blanchard, who is the trumpeter behind Louis the gator's music, will also be back.
The main voice actors from the movie will return for the ride, too.
Driving the news: Disney executives and imagineers made the music announcement in New Orleans during a multi-day media tour last moth of the places Disney used to help conceptualize the story for the new ride. Stops included:
Dooky Chase's restaurant
Preservation Hall
Cajun Encounters swamp tour in St. Tammany
YAYA Arts Center
Historic New Orleans Collection
New Orleans Jazz Museum
Mardi Gras World

What they're saying: ""Authentic"" was a common drumbeat, with the Disney staffers saying they wanted New Orleanians to recognize their community in the attraction.
""Although Princess Tiana is a character in a story, the place and culture she comes from are real,"" said Carmen Smith, a senior vice president at Walt Disney Imagineering. ""We want people from New Orleans to say, 'Wow, they did their homework.' We want everyone else to book a flight.""
Flashback: Disney has a long history with New Orleans. The story goes that Walt Disney was driving through the city with his family and fell in love with the people, food, music and culture.
He took that experience and translated it into New Orleans Square in Disneyland.
The inspiration for Disney's popular animatronic creations came from New Orleans, says Jason Recher, a vice president at Disney Parks. Walt, as the cast members call him, found a mechanical bird during one trip, bought it and gave it to his crew to figure out how it worked.
There was talk that Disney even looked at opening Disney World in New Orleans before deciding on Orlando, where it opened in 1971.
Between the lines: For ""Princess and the Frog,"" Disney teams took three research trips to New Orleans.
For the new ride, the imagineers have had at least half a dozen research trips, studying everything from the role of women in New Orleans in the 1920s to the flora and fauna in the bayou.
What's next: Look for New Orleans connections in two upcoming Disney projects:"

8495fa9c-882e-4f72-9667-46f23e0563da,‘Unprecedented’: KJP’s Worst Fears Appear To Be Coming True,"Karine Jean-Pierre has turned over her spotlight to Admiral John Kirby in an “unprecedented” way as the White House barrels toward a pivotal election season, a Daily Caller review of briefing data reveals.
Since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Kirby has been a mainstay at briefings alongside Jean-Pierre to answer reporters’ questions about the foreign conflict. Though Americans have indicated the war is not their top concern, Kirby has remained at the briefings — only missing five through January until Feb. 27. Of the briefings he has attended in 2024, 19 out of the 22 total held, Kirby has fielded questions for almost the exact same amount of time as Jean-Pierre.
As of Feb. 27, Jean-Pierre has spent about 11 hours and 31 minutes at the White House press briefing podium this year across 22 briefings. Kirby has answered questions for just under nine hours and two minutes in 19 briefings. In those 19 briefings when Kirby and Jean-Pierre were together, the press secretary spoke for just shy of nine hours and 11 minutes — almost a perfect fifty-fifty split with her counterpart.
“There is no precedent for this. Press secretaries always bring guests, right. It’s like, ‘Hey, we’re gonna have the OMB [the Office of Management and Budget] guys brief you on the budget and talk to you about that.’ That’s normal,” Sean Spicer, one-time press secretary for former President Donald Trump, told the Daily Caller. “That’s as old as the job. But this idea that you have a co-press secretary is unprecedented.”
Some other names have made appearances at briefings and gaggles, either alongside Jean-Pierre or Kirby: deputy press secretary Olivia Dalton, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, White House spokesman for oversight and investigations Ian Sams and a few other policy-specific officials from the administration.
But none have appeared nearly as often as Kirby, who Jean-Pierre was reportedly concerned might usurp her as press secretary when she first got the job. Biden “awkwardly” added that Kirby would be joining Jean-Pierre’s team when the president gave her the press secretary position in 2022, leaving her “upset and confused,” according to Axios.
Jean-Pierre’s appointment was lauded as historic and powerful when she got the job — she’s the first black press secretary, and is also a lesbian woman of immigrant parents. From the beginning, things have reportedly been rocky, though — Biden also allegedly said that Jean-Pierre didn’t need to worry because she’d “have an admiral looking over your shoulder,” a comment that was not received well by the new press secretary.
Amid the tension between Kirby and Jean-Pierre, the latter’s top deputy, Dalton, is reportedly ditching the White House for a gig at Apple.
That leaves a clear path to the top job for Kirby. He has told some around the White House he’s interested in the position, according to Axios, but other White House officials denied those accounts.
When it comes to gaggles, Kirby has appeared at more as of late, speaking at seven of them between the start of the year and Feb. 16 for a total of more than an hour and seven minutes. The pair has attended four gaggles together, with Jean-Pierre answering questions for more than 41 minutes.
“I don’t think the dynamic is awkward to begin with. I think they did it under the presence, under the guise of national security and foreign affairs. But the reality is, Kirby has really taken over a lot more, for obvious reasons,” Spicer said. “The press secretary should be able to handle all of the issues and it’s pretty obvious that there’s a level of competence that just doesn’t exist.”
The White House previously attributed Kirby’s frequent presence at briefings to the war in the Middle East, adding that he will be featured less once it subsides, the New York Times reported.
The White House and the National Security Council did not respond to the Daily Caller’s request for comment.
Kirby’s attendance at the briefings has dipped slightly. Spanning from Hamas’ Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel until Jan. 5, 2024, Jean-Pierre had only held one press briefing or gaggle on Air Force One by herself, according to an Axios count. Jean-Pierre was always accompanied by Kirby or even on occasion National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.
The national security council spokesperson has continued to attend the press briefings alongside Jean-Pierre specifically because the president enjoys it, Axios reported. Biden has reportedly asked the spokesman to personally brief him and also travel with him on both domestic and international trips.
In devoting roughly half their briefing time with Kirby in attendance to foreign affairs, the White House is granting a disproportionate amount of air to issues voters say they aren’t as concerned about. Americans have indicated that they are more interested in domestic topics, with immigration now the top issue among the populous, according to a February Gallup poll. Twenty-eight percent of Americans say the issue is their main priority while just 3% say foreign aid and issues overseas are the most important to them.
The next top concern was government, as 20% of Americans voted it their main worry, the Gallup poll showed. “Economy in general,” inflation, “poverty/hunger/homelessness” and “unifying the country” followed in Americans’ most important issues.
With Kirby focused on issues falling into international affairs, Jean-Pierre remains the public face of the administration on most domestic issues. Biden’s poll numbers on many of those issues are struggling, and some have wondered if she is long for the job. Her predecessor, Jen Psaki, departed the post just shy of the 16-month mark.
Kirby’s performance has been better received by some observers.
“Sometimes I’ll tweet out, like, ‘this was a good job by Kirby.’ I’ve had a number of [Republicans] tell me that Kirby gets it. I mean, I actually think he has the respect of Republicans. And so therefore, they listen to what he has to say and they find him to be a credible messenger. I don’t think anybody respects Karine,” Scott Jennings, a longtime GOP adviser in Kentucky and veteran of numerous campaigns, told the Daily Caller.
“And so if you’re a White House, and you’re trying to communicate to the larger world and also the people in Washington, you know, your chief messenger has to be credible and respected. I think Kirby has achieved that.”
“I can’t remember a time when this has happened. I mean, it seems to me they give Kirby all the important things to talk about. And they let her talk about the rest,” Jennings told the Daily Caller.

In its decision, the 5th Circuit panel threw out the guilty plea and six-year prison sentence for Zackey Rahimi, who admitted to possessing guns found in his Kennedale, Texas, home after prosecutors said he participated in five shootings in December 2020, and January 2021.
Rahimi had been under a restraining order since Feb. 2020, following his alleged assault of a former girlfriend.
The order suspended Rahimi's handgun license and prohibited him from possessing firearms, The New York Times reported Monday.
Rahimi, however, defied the order, according to court records.
The Times reported he threatened a different woman with a gun, leading to charges of assault with a deadly weapon. Then, he opened fire in public five times within two months.
The shootings prompted a search warrant of Rahimi's home, where weapons were discovered. He was charged with violating the federal law.
In March, the Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to allow a federal law stand that makes it a crime for people under domestic violence restraining orders to own firearms.
The Times added that the chances that the Supreme Court will agree to hear the case are good.
That's because the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals initially affirmed Rahimi's conviction but then reversed course after the Supreme Court last June issued a decision that established a new test to decide whether gun control laws are constitutional.
Under that test, the 5th Circuit's three-judge panel unanimously ruled the law prohibiting people subject to domestic-violence orders from possessing firearms violated the Second Amendment because there was no historical support for it.
The case, United States v. Rahimi, No. 22-915, would give the justices an opportunity to explore the extent of its new test, which requires the government to identify historical decisons to justify laws limiting Second Amendment rights.

ef9227f0-5d9d-451e-ba71-908a4eacf1c1,"MG4 XPOWER Driven: First Electric Hot Hatch, And It’s Not Expensive","The MG4 was one of the most important electric cars launched in 2022. It set a new benchmark for affordability and has understandably been selling like hot cakes ever since. But even in 2022 MG was teasing a future version that could be equally momentous – a dual-motor model. This has now arrived in the form of the MG4 XPOWER. It’s the first true electric hot hatch and will give traditional internal combustion-powered fast compact cars a lot to worry about. I took it for a test drive.
MG4 XPOWER: They Mean Power
The MG4 XPOWER has a significant motor power upgrade over the Long Range version upon which it is based. While it still uses the same 64kWh battery as the latter, there are now two motors. The Long Range had a 150kW (201hp) motor on the rear, but the XPOWER shifts this to the front and adds a 170kW (228hp) unit on the rear instead. This gives a total of 320kW (429hp) and 600Nm (443lb/ft) of torque, which is an obscene amount for a relatively small hatchback.
At last there's an electric hot hatch - and it's surprisingly affordable. James Morris
MG claims the XPOWER can hit 62mph in just 3.8 seconds, which is around the same as a Tesla Model Y Performance or Ford Musang Mach-E GT. However, this requires the invocation of launch control, where you hold down the brake and accelerator at the same down, then let go of the brake to take off. Either way, MG says this is the company’s most powerful production car ever. The bonkers but ill-fated MG Xpower SV-R only had 385hp and wasn’t as fast accelerating as the MG4 XPOWER by some margin, although the latter’s stop speed is only 124mph.
The XPOWER uses the same basis as the MG4 Long Range. James Morris
The 64kWh (61.8kWh net) battery delivers a lower WLTP range than the Long Range MG4 – 239 miles versus up to 281. The extra motor adds 115kg over the Long Range, for a total of 1800kg, and overall efficiency is lower. That’s not hugely encouraging for long-distance driving, but DC charging hits 140kW, so on a fast enough device the MG4 XPOWER can be replenished from 10 to 80% in just 35 minutes. A top-up of this duration every 2-3 hours on a lengthy journey wouldn’t be too onerous.
MG4 XPOWER: Sober Appearance
If the performance potential is outrageous, the appearance isn’t. MG calls it “understated”. The only real signs that this car is the XPOWER version are the 18in “Cyclone” alloy wheels and orange brake calipers with the model name on them. The latter highlights the considerable brake upgrade from 300mm to 345mm ventilated discs, which MG claims can bring the car to a complete stop from 62mph in just 33.9m. It’s reassuring that the company has considered this aspect of a car that can hit high speeds so rapidly.
Special alloy wheels and orange brake calipers are the only sign this car is the XPOWER MG4. James Morris
However, I’d like to have seen a few more visual indications of the special status of the MG4 XPOWER. It doesn’t even have a badge on the rear. That would be nice, along with perhaps some differently colored stitching and seatbelts. MG UK says it will be pushing for this in the future, but the sober look of the car will be a downside for some, even if it gives the XPOWER considerable Q car appeal. Also on show at the launch was the EX3 race car based on the MG4 XPOWER, which was on its way to the Goodwood Festival of Speed for the hill climb. That’s the other end of the scale for appearance. Something in between the two would suit this car nicely.

That said, this is still a practical hatchback. The front seats, covered in Alcantara, are very comfortable. The driver’s seat is also electrically adjusted, although the passenger’s seat isn’t. The rear seats have adequate space for a couple of adults. There’s no armrest in the middle, and you’d only want to put a child in that place. There’s also a reasonable amount of luggage space in the rear. You get 363 liters with the rear seats up, and 1165 liters with them down, which is a bit behind a Volkswagen ID. 3 and almost exactly the same as a Nissan Leaf.
MG4 XPOWER: How Does It Drive?
If you just wanted a practical, affordable electric hatchback, however, you’d go for one of the standard MG4 versions. The XPOWER is all about the driving experience. It’s obviously quicker than the regular car. The throttle response isn’t quite as immediate as a Tesla, but even a light press of the accelerator will get this vehicle moving fast. I found a quiet section of road with a 60mph limit and tried the launch control. It was very fierce, although it’s worth mentioning that you can get something similar from a Tesla Model 3 or Y Performance without needing any special pedal combinations.

The MG4 XPOWER has a Dynamic Cornering System, which includes locking electronic differentials and Intelligent Motor Control. This enables torque vectoring, so power can be distributed to individual wheels to improve handling and traction. The springs and dampers have been recalibrated and tuned, with stiffer anti-roll bars. MG claims the suspension is 25% stiffer. During my test drive, there weren’t that many opportunities to push this to the limit, but I still found myself throwing the car into corners with enthusiasm.
Thanks to the rear-wheel-drive, the original MG4 was already quite fun, despite not being particularly quick. The XPOWER is a bit heavier but instils you with confidence immediately. Although it’s only 47kg lighter than a Tesla Model 3, it’s over 40cm shorter. It feels very capable of being chucked round bends. The grip from the Bridgestone Turanza tires feels very sure footed. Even without the full power of launch control, the MG4 XPOWER can thrust away from the apex of a corner with considerable satisfaction.

It also sits comfortably at highway speeds and has a decent amount of torque to perform decisive overtakes. However, the power is clearly optimized for lower speeds. The MG4 XPOWER is an A road monster, which is exactly what you need from your Hot Hatch. For those who want to take their driving even more seriously, the software allows you to display live lap times and G-force data.
MG4 XPOWER: Surprisingly Affordable
You might be expecting the significant extra power and performance would cost a fortune, but MG is offering the XPOWER in the UK for £36,495 ($47,000), which makes it cheaper than a Volkswagen Golf GTI and a lot cheaper than an Audi RS3. It beats the former soundly and matches the latter in straight-line speed. MG doesn’t offer any option packs, other than color choices, including a rather fetching green, so there’s not much to push the price higher. You get a seven-year, 80,000-mile warranty, including the battery. Although this isn’t exactly a cheap car, costing around £10,000 ($13,000) more than the base model, the value is still obvious, even compared to internal combustion alternatives.

MG also presented a second model at the XPOWER launch – an Extended Range version with 77kWh battery for same price as the XPOWER, giving it an impressive 323 miles of WLTP range. This is equipped with a 180kW (241hp) rear motor, so it’s a bit quicker than the Long Range, taking just 6.5 miles to reach 62mph. It comes with the same Trophy specification as is available with the Long Range.
That car might be the more practical option for many, as the range is in Tesla territory and beats many more expensive cars from Kia or Hyundai. But if you don’t need this mile-munching capability, the MG4 XPOWER delivers something we’ve spent years hoping for – a truly fast small EV. There are others on the way, such as the smart #1 Brabus. But they won’t match this car for price. MG has done it again, delivering a huge amount of EV for a very keen cost. In terms of electric thrills for the money, the MG4 XPOWER is hard to beat."

Environmental, social and governance (ESG) efforts have unfortunately become a fertile ground for greenwashing, where companies attempt to create a facade of responsibility without genuine commitment. Greenwashing in the context of ESG often takes several forms, including but not limited to selective disclosure, vague terminology, token gestures, exaggerated claims and cherry-picking data.
For PR professionals, the challenge is to artfully weave storytelling with steadfast transparency, striking a careful balance between engaging audiences emotionally and upholding the rigorous standards of ESG. And at the core of this narrative lies trust and transparency.
However, trust is a two-way street. Corporations can’t shoulder it alone; PR firms must also be held accountable for the narratives we shape. The big question: How can PR professionals assess trust in client information? Let’s delve into the strategies that can empower PR firms to take a leadership role for a more accountable, sustainable future.
Navigating The Ethical Terrain: Key Concerns For PR Pros
Tackling this issue requires finesse and sensitivity. In the fragile client-consultant dynamic, you can deftly maneuver by underlining the critical role of trust. Your commitment extends beyond client advocacy to guaranteeing the credibility and genuineness of the information. This involves checking facts, verifying data and critically assessing major claims. Framing it as a joint quest for authenticity nurtures transparency and respect in the partnership. This strategy reinforces your commitment to long-term success and mutual benefit.
It’s crucial to ensure that clients are heading in the right direction. One key method is establishing a clear set of ethical guidelines and expectations at the outset of any client relationship. Regularly assessing actions against these standards is essential. Additionally, seek external perspectives, engage in open discussions with clients, and consider seeking third-party audits or certifications to validate ethical practices.
Genuine Commitment, Clear Communication
Ultimately, good faith is at the heart of PR professionalism. It’s about trusting that your clients are sincere in their intentions to do right by ESG principles and society. However, it’s also about due diligence, ensuring faith is backed by evidence. The aim is not to catch clients in deceit but to help them navigate the ESG landscape with integrity.
A good PR strategy not only boosts a company’s reputation but can also spotlight its eco-friendly, socially responsible and well-governed achievements. It doesn’t shy away from potentially adverse impacts. More and more firms, such as Philippines-based Ayala Corp., are openly acknowledging environmental challenges in their energy-related businesses and outlining concrete steps they are taking to mitigate them.
Driving Positive Change
Maintaining credibility within the PR industry hinges on a commitment to accountability and ethical practices. To uphold trust, you must ensure that the messages you convey on behalf of your clients are accurate and reliable. It’s about being upfront and transparent and avoiding the pitfalls of greenwashing. An illustrative example that caught media attention was when McDonald’s introduced paper straws in 2019, only to discover they weren’t recyclable. This incident underscored the importance of transparency in PR.
Coming clean about any missteps or issues is vital to prevent greenwashing. PR is not just about shaping narratives; it’s a powerful tool for driving positive change. By leveraging the proper communications channels, you can raise awareness and promote activism, catalyzing behavioral shifts. Consider REI, the American outdoor retailer, which closes its stores on Black Friday, urging people to #OptOutside. It’s like a gym closing during the first week of January to avoid those shortsighted sign-ups—the people who would just keep paying without any real intention or ability to start regular workouts. This bold move promotes sustainability and underscores the brand’s commitment to ESG values, including employee well-being.
PR Pros: Bridging The Gap In ESG Storytelling
ESG initiatives should originate from and question the very core of a business. These are not just public relations or marketing maneuvers but fundamental to a company’s values and operations.
So, yes, the business side should drive these initiatives.
But—and this is where we come in—PR professionals can play a pivotal role as advisors. We’re the translators, the bridge builders, the storytellers. We might not be ESG experts per se, but our expertise lies in understanding complex subjects and showcasing their interconnectedness to consumers, communities and the world at large.
We need to learn the terrain, ask questions and bring our communication savvy to the table. It’s about helping the business side express their ESG commitments in a way that resonates with and can be understood by everyone. As brand custodians, we must distill brand and business information for stakeholders in a simple, relevant and relatable way.
The other critical aspect of our role is managing a brand’s most precious asset—consumer and community trust. We understand trust is not a static truth. Brand trust can be eroded instantly or lose hold over time if not keenly managed and nurtured.
In an era where news is real-time, multimedia and often mistaken for propaganda, we recognize consumer cynicism is the default context in which brands operate. PR firms risk becoming soulless mouthpieces in today’s fast-paced, hyperconnected world. The pressure to meet client demands and deliver results often leads to a focus on messaging rather than meaningful communication. Therefore, it is incumbent on us as communication experts to deliver insights from the public, facilitate conversations and ensure that a company’s ESG journey is communicated authentically and empathetically.
This means our code of conduct for business needs to be rooted in authenticity and transparency. In PR, there’s a growing call for agencies to be transparent about the ESG communications we do for our clients. Embracing accountability is not just a matter of business ethics; it is a strategic imperative for PR firms today wanting to stay relevant and respected tomorrow.

38a75c74-2c35-42bc-87c1-0ea121e6b62e,Column: Team USA always comes home with some drama. Just never the Ryder Cup,"GUIDONIA MONTECELIO, Italy (AP) — The Americans always seem to come home from the Ryder Cup with plenty of drama.
Just never the trophy.
Maybe they need another task force to figure out a way to tip their caps — whoever is wearing one, anyway — and congratulate Team Europe for a superior performance, and then wait for their next chance to end three decades of losing on the road.
But there was Phil Mickelson in 2014 at Gleneagles, using Tom Watson as leverage to give players more control over who gets to be captain. It led to a task force that has accomplished little else besides making the U.S. team feel like a social club.
Then it was Patrick Reed in 2018 in Paris, getting on the phone with The New York Times after Europe had won convincingly. He blamed Jordan Spieth for breaking up their partnership, Jim Furyk for benching him twice and the entire U.S. team for putting ego over the Ryder Cup.
And now it’s the father of Xander Schauffele, who watches golf with a monocular and speaks with a megaphone.
“I’ve already done seven or eight interviews today,” Stefan Schauffele said Sunday from just beyond the first tee at Marco Simone as he waited for his son’s singles match to start.
The topic sounded dramatic — Xander Schauffele potentially not playing in the Ryder Cup over a contract dispute — and it provided perfect fodder after the cup had been won. For now, it at least took heat away from Zach Johnson. Captains usually are the first to get blamed in defeat.
Stefan Schauffele spoke of a back and forth with the PGA of America over the “Player Participation and Benefits Agreement,” how he wanted three amendments to the contract. It took a few weeks to get everyone on the same page and then it was sorted out.
One of those changes involved media — “streamers” is what he called them — not having access to private team areas. That led to Johnson taking a pulse from his team and Netflix having limited access for its “Full Swing” document series. The vote was 12-0.
This is all minutiae. The ultimate goal of Stefan Schauffele is for Ryder Cup players to be compensated, a topic he first raised at Whistling Straits and one that certainly isn’t original. The Ryder Cup rakes in millions, and players have no stake in the PGA of America. It’s always been a reasonable discussion, just not during the week of the matches.
“I’m creating a foundation to build our defense for future payment,” Stefan Schauffele had said in the weeks leading to the Ryder Cup.
He had an audience at Marco Simone, in part prompted by an unsubstantiated Sky Sports report that Patrick Cantlay wasn’t wearing a cap to protest not getting paid.
“Not a shred of truth in the article that just one journalist wrote,” Cantlay said.
The hat story made its way to some 40,000 cap-waving fans at Marco Simone, led to a tense moment between Rory McIlroy and Cantlay’s caddie and lingered after the matches. It forever will be a memory of this Ryder Cup, just like the American rainsuits at Celtic Manor in 2010.
There is substance to the pay-for-play conversation, of course. But it is not limited to only the Ryder Cup.
Cantlay and Schauffele are not alone is raising questions about the revenue at all the majors, and what percentage goes to the players, who are most responsible for it.
The PGA Tour does not run any of the majors or the Ryder Cup. The PGA of America gives the tour 20% of its Ryder Cup television contract, which a tour official said goes into its general operating budget.
This is old news, dating to at least 1997.
Would it have come up at Marco Simone if there was anything else to talk about besides Cantlay not wearing a hat or Europe not missing a beat when it comes to winning big at home?
And then there’s Stefan Schauffele, part German and part French, a little bit of Austrian and 100% invested in his son. He relishes taking on golf’s powerbrokers.
He wrote a 2,600-word email to PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan asking why his son did not get credit for an official win at the 2020 Tour Championship when Schauffele had the low score but Dustin Johnson (who started at 10-under par as the No. 1 seed) won the FedEx Cup.
He threatened his son’s participation in the Olympics in a back and forth with USA Golf over accommodations and other restrictions during the pandemic-effected games in Tokyo. Xander Schauffele went and conquered, winning the gold medal.
Stefan Schauffele is an interesting character in his own right. He had Olympic aspirations until getting hit by a drunken driver on his way to Germany’s training camp for the 1988 Games. He lost his left eye and his Olympic dreams, and then he found golf. A PGA professional, he is the only coach Xander has had. His nickname is “Ogre,” and he embraces it.
Cantlay was asked in the Sunday evening news conference whether he was not wearing a hat to avoid tan lines for his wedding pictures (he got married Monday in Rome). That prompted laughter and a query of the source. He was told it was Stefan Schauffele on German radio.
That prompted Xander Schauffele to pull the microphone toward him and say with a smile, “I apologize for anything my father said.”
Still to be determined is how much the father is speaking for the son, and what effect this has on Xander Schauffele going forward.
He is a seven-time PGA Tour winner, has spent the last five years in or around the top 10 in the world and doesn’t get bothered by much, unless it’s the PGA Tour doing a deal with Saudi Arabia without anyone knowing it. He made his feelings clear about that.
The last thing a team needs is outside noise, which only gets louder after losing.

90bdc236-c157-484a-b35e-3a9299048b56,Hunter Biden plea deal reeks: How could THIS take five years?,"How does it take five years to come up with this?
As we’d long feared, the five-year Hunter Biden investigation is wrapping in a plea deal over charges the Justice Department simply couldn’t avoid bringing — because the public record established Hunter’s guilt on them long ago.
It reeks — because if this were truly all Hunter is guilty of, it wouldn’t have taken this long, or be shrouded in so much mystery.
Hunter basically admitted guilt on the tax-avoidance counts years ago, when he (or, rather, a wealthy “friend”) paid the back taxes. And he effectively confessed to the gun charge in his autobiography, writing up his vast drug use at the very time he applied for a gun license without mentioning it.
And we know the Secret Service retrieved the gun after his then-inamorata tossed it in a public trash bin.
But other obvious and apparent crimes didn’t get charged: He never registered as a foreign agent, even as his laptop and other evidence shows he was lobbying. He was blatantly peddling influence — the only possible explanation for the millions he scored in Ukraine and China is his last name.
Nor do prosecutors seem to have followed up on clear indications of money-laundering (money moved through a vast network of accounts to other members of the family) or even sex-trafficking (again, the laptop alone shows ample payment for hookers of all kinds).

Biden essentially confessed to the gun charge in his autobiography.
Prosecutors did not follow up on any alleged sex-trafficking charges against Biden despite images from his laptop depicting him with prostitutes.
On the money-laundering, especially, we know the IRS (apparently at Justice Department direction) axed the expert team that had been digging into Hunter’s vast web of accounts.
Were they getting too close? How could their replacements have possibly finished the work in bare weeks, so prosecutors could in good confidence opt against charges?
What of the whistleblower allegations of political interference in the case, and of retaliation against the whistleblowers?
David Weiss, the Delaware US attorney, claims the investigation is “ongoing,” but that sounds like a dodge to keep House Republicans off his back. Hunter’s lawyer and friends are treating this as the end of the story.
And what an end it is. Hunter gets off easy even by the low standards set by the charges. Misdemeanors for the taxes. The only felony he could have faced, over the gun, is waved away as long as Hunter straightens up and flies right.
Again, this investigation began back in 2018, and we know the feds soon had enough evidence to convict on the charges finally brought — perhaps before, and surely soon after, the 2020 election.
Are we supposed to believe they held off so long because they were looking into more consequential crimes (as deploying a top IRS team indicates), only to suddenly decide (after firing that team!) that they couldn’t prove anything else?

Despite the obvious impropriety of the Justice Department investigating the president’s son (and as that president repeatedly, loudly and publicly declared his son innocent), Attorney General Merrick Garland refused to name an independent counsel to take this case.
If a special prosecutor of clear integrity had offered this plea deal now, it’d still stink but might be something the public could swallow.
But as things stand, the only possible conclusion is that Justice is corrupt."

Artificial intelligence has weighed in on the sports GOAT — the greatest of all time — and while it did not settle the debate, the answer is not good for LeBron James.
In a pair of prompts, we asked ChatGPT about the greatest athlete and greatest basketball player of all time. While James was listed among seven candidates for the NBA GOAT, only Michael Jordan was listed among the greatest athletes across sports.
If ChatGPT is to be believed, this hurts the argument that James is considered a greater basketball player than Jordan.
We started with a simple prompt for ChatGPT: ""Who is the greatest athlete of all time?""
OpenAI's chatbot took the high road, noting that the answer is subjective and depends on many factors, including ""the sport, their influence on and off the field, their records, and personal preferences."" However, ChatGPT nonetheless narrowed the list to six athletes in five different sports as being most commonly accepted as the sports GOAT:
Michael Jordan in basketball. Serena Williams in tennis. Usain Bolt in athletics. Pele or Lionel Messi in football (soccer). Michael Phelps in swimming.
ChatGPT then concluded with a virtual participation trophy for all six, adding: ""It's important to note that this is a topic of much debate, and there's no definitive answer. Each athlete has achieved outstanding performances in their respective fields, making them all 'great' in their own way.""
While other NBA players are occasionally brought up, the two names most often put in the running for the best NBA player ever are Jordan and James. It's one of the most hotly contested debates in team sports. Supporters of Jordan point to his dominance, 6-0 record in the NBA Finals, and global impact beyond the game. Meanwhile, those who argue for LeBron point to his all-around skills, basketball IQ, and 10 trips to the NBA Finals (with four wins).
While we specifically asked for the sports GOAT, the mention of Jordan without James puts a big dent in the basketball debate. How can LeBron be greater than Jordan if His Airness is a top candidate for greatest of ALL athletes and LeBron is not even in the picture?
ChatGPT's responses are coming from huge amounts of publicly-available data and conversations on the internet (although where exactly is still not clear). And if you ask it to settle the debate on the GOAT, LeBron won't be the answer.

We also asked ChatGPT to name the greatest of all time in the NBA, and James was listed among seven candidates. The list also included Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, and Kobe Bryant.
It is worth mentioning that ChatGPT's knowledge is minimal for anything that occurred after September 2021. The time before that cutoff includes all of LeBron's championships and MVP trophies. The one notable event not included is LeBron passing Abdul-Jabbar as the NBA's all-time leading scorer.
ChatGPT's response also aligns with the responses of Americans asked about the basketball GOAT in a 2019 Insider poll. Overwhelmingly, most people picked Jordan as the GOAT of the NBA."

Summary Tunisia and Egypt's economic strains have mounted this year
FX and bond markets have been turbulent
Tunisia's reserves are low while Egypt has mass of debt payments
LONDON, May 11 (Reuters) - Tunisia and Egypt are edging closer to major debt crises which could suck in a volatile North Africa region and pose tough choices to wealthy Gulf Arab neighbours, investors and analysts warn.
The countries are already being challenged by shortages of essential goods and financial market dysfunction and in Tunisia's case, a political crisis caused by President Kais Saied's consolidation of power and crackdown on opponents.
Egypt, as north Africa's largest economy and most populous nation, has long been assumed to be too big to be allowed to fail, but Tunisia too carries outsized significance as the birthplace - and supposed sole success story - of the Arab Spring.
Tunis' hopes for a long-awaited International Monetary Fund (IMF) support are still flickering, although concerns remain whether it would stick to a programme given the fractured politics.
President Saied has criticised the IMF, saying Tunisia will not bow to its ""diktats"" on food and energy subsidy cuts and a reduction in the public wage bill, warning it could fuel renewed social upheaval.
""Given the current politics, you have to question whether an IMF programme would even survive a first or second review,"" said Matt Vogel, at emerging and frontier market asset manager FIM Partners.
Without sustained IMF help, though, the country faces a full-blown balance of payments crisis.
One of the highest public sector wage bills in the world means its fiscal deficit will remain around 5% of GDP, JPMorgan estimates, while Morgan Stanley warns FX reserves won't even cover two months of basic imports this time next year at their current rate of attrition.
Making debt payments could become almost impossible. Most of the country's borrowings are domestic, but it has a 500 million euro foreign loan repayment in October followed by another in February next year. .
""There is always a risk that the IMF programme is delayed for such a long time that when it comes it is too little, too late"" said Matt Robinson, a senior sovereign analyst at credit rating agency Moody's.
On the risk of a default? ""That could be an eventual outcome. That is what our low rating is pointing to"".
EGYPT
Egypt's finances also look stretched despite it securing a $3 billion IMF rescue plan in December.
Its debt-to-GDP ratio is fast approaching 100% and three major currency devaluations totalling 50% in little over a year means the interest payments on its debt alone - a large slab of which is borrowed in dollars, euros or yen - will soak up over half of the government's revenues next year according to Fitch.
The rating agency, which downgraded Egypt's credit rating again on Friday, highlights that only default-stricken Sri Lanka would need to pay more. And like that example, a lack of dollars in Cairo's local currency markets is biting the economy.
The Egyptian pound now changes hands at over 38 to the dollar on the streets, nearly 20% below the currency's official rate despite the repeated devaluations and interest rates jumping to 18.25%.
Many economists believe they will have to go much higher still, all of which will feed a problematic economic narrative for next year's presidential elections.
""For the population, up until the pandemic, there had been a marginal improvement in living standards,"" said David Butter, an Associate Fellow on London-based think tank Chatham House's Middle East and North Africa Programme.
""But since late 2021, we have gone back into this cycle of instability on the exchange rate market and soaring inflation"".
President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's government has rubbished talk of a default and to help plug the funding holes is targetting $2 billion worth of state-owned asset sales by the end of June.
Whether that's achieved will be crucial, both for the IMF which expects sell offs to cover roughly half of Egypt's $17 billion funding gap over the next four years, and for Gulf allies Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar that have traditionally bailed the country out.
They are currently taking a tougher stance which analysts put down to neighbourly politics and differences over valuations of the assets to be sold, although there are still positive noises being made.
UAE Economy Minister Abdullah bin Touq Al Marri told Reuters on a recent trip to London that, ""the UAE and Egypt will always stand together"" adding that infrastructure funding showed the relationship between the two was ""very deep"" and ""very dynamic"".
NOT IMMATERIAL
For regular asset managers, though, there has been a painful 20% slump in Egypt's near $30 billion worth of international bonds this year.
Suez Canal and tourism revenues may be improving, but Cairo has a combined $5.8 billion worth of 'principal' and 'coupon' payments on those bonds next year which also carry a 2% 'weight' in the world's most closely-followed emerging market debt index.
Carl Ross, a veteran of EM crises at fund manager GMO, said the wealthy Gulf states would have to balance the cost of supporting Egypt against the risk of regional instability if a country with a 110 million population went bust.
""It would not be immaterial if it were to default"" Ross said about the impact on global money managers.
""These very wealthy Gulf countries have generally enhanced financial stability in the region,"" via their support he added. ""No one knows how long this will persist and under what conditions.""

3340ef7c-567c-417a-8c1f-61431eb2b21e,"More than 300 Americans have left Gaza in recent days, deputy national security adviser says","White House: More than 300 Americans have left Gaza More than 300 Americans have left Gaza in recent days, deputy National Security Adviser says 06:50
Washington — Hundreds of Americans have been able to leave Gaza in recent days after ""intensive negotiations,"" according to a top national security adviser to President Biden, as fears grow that the conflict between Israel and Hamas could expand.
""We believe that there are still a number of Americans inside Gaza,"" deputy national security adviser Jon Finer told ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday. ""But over the last several days, through pretty intensive negotiations with all sides relevant to this conflict, we have been able to get out more than 300 Americans, lawful permanent residents and their family members.""
The U.S. State Department has estimated that around 400 Americans have been trapped in Gaza, which has been pummeled by Israeli airstrikes since the terrorist attack by Hamas militants on Israel on Oct. 7 that left more than 1,400 people dead.
Border crossings in and out of Gaza have been closed since the attack, trapping those who wished to flee the conflict. In recent days, there have been limited evacuations into Egypt through the Rafah border crossing.
Finer said negotiations over the release of hostages are happening ""quietly behind the scenes"" and are taking ""longer than any of us would like."" More than 200 are believed to be held hostage by Hamas.
""We continue to believe that there is the possibility of getting a significant number of these hostages released,"" Finer said.
The U.S. has called for a humanitarian pause in fighting to secure the release of the hostages, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said there will be no temporary pause without the release of all hostages.
""You heard the prime minister of Israel say yesterday that the context in which they would consider a pause would be related to a hostage agreement,"" Finer said. ""We don't obviously have yet hostage agreements. But, again, we're working very hard to get one, and if that were to take place, just being able to move hostages around the battlefield in a way that is safe, get them to a gate leading outside of Gaza would take time and we would want to only be able to do that safely. So we believe a pause would be appropriate in that context.""
Mr. Biden is also facing pressure from his own party regarding civilian casualties and humanitarian concerns as Israel's bombardment progresses. Thousands protested in the nation's capitol over the weekend to push for a cease-fire as the Palestinian death toll rises.
Finer said the administration is pressing Israel on those issues. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is in the Middle East meeting with Israeli and Arab leaders, has stressed that Israel must adhere to the laws of war and protect civilians while increasing humanitarian aid supplies to Gaza.
""The devastating toll that this has taken on civilians is one that deeply concerns us,"" Finer said. ""One that we raised in a very direct way both publicly — as Secretary Blinken has done, as others have done — and privately and directly with the government of Israel. There are certain responsibilities that any army has in the context of waging a military operation like this and they're widely known. They're related to international humanitarian law and we expect them to be followed."""

OPI weighed into the ""Vanderpump Rules"" drama by implying white nail polish — a favorite for Tom Sandoval — is dead.
On Friday, the nail brand shared a TikTok slideshow featuring a recent Glamour article titled ""Tom Sandoval Has Ruined White Nail Polish For Everyone."" The article suggests that white polish is ""the only thing Sandoval has been loyal to all season"" amid a cheating scandal involving Ariana Madix and Raquel Leviss — making the color unappealing to some fans.

According to E! News, Sandoval wasn't keen on Glamour's hot take. He clapped back in a now-deleted Instagram story that included a screenshot of the article's headline.
""So sorry. Nothing I wear seems to ever look good on [troll and hair flip emoji],"" Sandoval wrote. ""At least have the courage to @ me if ur gonna talk shit.""
He added: ""I thought ur mag was about being positive & glamorous, not trashy? Also what happens when I wear all the colors at Michigan PRIDE shows? I'd invite u, but unfortunately, we're all sold out.""
He continued to deride the article in a series of follow-up posts, the outlet reported.

""With writing such a disgusting, trashy, hateful & bias article, how can u dare call urself a 'journalist?' 'Reign of Terror?' I'm a human being and u don't know me,"" he wrote.
The outlet reported that some ""Vanderpump Rules"" fans had decried both white nail polish and Sandoval on Twitter.
Sandoval has taken center stage among the ""Vanderpump Rules"" cast after it was revealed he had an affair with costar Raquel Leviss while in a relationship with Madix. Sandoval and Madix had dated for nine years when news of the affair reached fans in March.

Most recently, Madix appeared on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast this Wednesday and discussed the affair. She claimed, among other things, that Sandoval once left their shared bed while she was asleep and had sex with Leviss in the couple's guest room."

cb3ecdf8-1dd5-48f3-9acc-bbe1eeadb108,Judge: Pa. School District Must Allow After School Satan Club,"A federal judge on Monday ordered a Pennsylvania school district to allow the After School Satan Club to use its middle school after previously denying the group's application.
Judge John Gallagher of U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania ruled in a 37-page opinion the Saucon Valley School District must allow the After School Satan Club, which is sponsored by The Satanic Temple, to meet during the school year on three previously agreed-upon dates at Saucon Valley Middle School.
Gallagher also ruled the district does not have to distribute fliers and parental permission slips to students.
The school district, located about 90 minutes north of Philadelphia, initially allowed the club to use the middle school, but after complaints from parents and community members, including a threat of a mass shooting, and Facebook posts by the club advertising its visit that the district said violated its policy, it withdrew the club’s application, prompting the lawsuit.
“The Satanic Temple, Inc.’s objectors may challenge the sanctity of this controversially named organization, the sanctity of the First Amendment’s protections must prevail,” Gallagher wrote. “Indeed, it is the First Amendment that enumerates our freedoms to practice religion and express our viewpoints on religion and all the topics we consider sacred.”
The After School Satan Club said on its website “proselytization is not our goal, and we’re not interested in converting children to Satanism. After School Satan Clubs will focus on free inquiry and rationalism, the scientific basis for which we know what we know about the world around us. We prefer to give children an appreciation of the natural wonders surrounding them, not a fear of everlasting other-worldly horrors.”
The Satanic Temple, which claims it does not worship Satan but ""our beliefs must be malleable to the best current scientific understandings of the material world — never the reverse,"" was represented in the lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Pennsylvania and Philadelphia firm Dechert LLP.
“In a victory for free speech and religious freedom, a federal court has ruled that the Saucon Valley School District must allow the After School Satan Club to meet in district facilities,” the ACLU tweeted on Monday."

Barrie and 13-year-old Garrett Warren's bodies were found after police say they snuck through a hole in a fence to get into the Harlem River.
Democracy Prep Middle School made a touching post Monday for the sixth grader, saying, ""Alfa was someone who was a huge part of his school community - always lending a helping hand to his classmates and teachers, always showing his care and sweetness to his closest friends and family, and always living life with a smile on his face.""
Alfa Barrie loved to dance. In this video, you can see Alfa moving swiftly to the beat of the music with his teacher and classmates. Alfa was someone who was a huge part of his school community—always lending a helping hand to his classmates and teachers, always showing his care and sweetness to his closest friends and family, and always living life with a smile on his face. His teachers share that their classroom is not the same since Alfa’s passing, “We had a little family; you can tell he is not here.” Alfa is dearly missed and we honor his life by keeping his memory alive. Please join us in extending condolences to Alfa’s family during this difficult time. Posted by Democracy Prep Public Schools on Monday, May 22, 2023
Monday night, the Islamic community remembered one of the young lives cut short. It was a night filled with prayers at the Futa Islamic Center, where the community tried to come to terms with Barrie's death.
His mother's heart was shattered to pieces.
""Sad, depressed, there's no feeling that could explain losing your own son,"" said Ibrahim Diallo, Barrie's brother. ""Inside, I'm really emotional because this is something I've never been through in my life.""
Everyone remembered Barrie dancing, smiling and loving life.
""He used to have a beautiful smile. He was a kid who always wanted to have fun. It's very sad seeing him go,"" another person at the vigil said.

Last week, police said Barrie and Warren, his friend, accessed the shoreline of the Harlem River through a hole in the fence.
Warren's body was found near the Madison Bridge on May 18. Two days later, Barrie's body was found floating in the Hudson River.
""The next step is helping us figure out what was the reason for his death. There are many questions and we would like answers,"" said Diallo.
As they struggle to find answers, Diallo can't stop wondering about the life his brother would have led.
""He wanted to be the best engineer because he saw this as an avenue not only for himself to get a career, but also as a way to help others,"" Diallo said.
A memorial service will be held inside the school gym at 4 p.m., followed by a short press conference with Barrie's family, then an evening vigil."

5da7a757-8e55-4088-b28e-dc497d2b9ebf,Breitbart Business Digest: The Economy Is Not Being Throttled by High Interest Rates,"Searching for True Neutrality
The Fed ostensibly charts its course by the stars of a “neutral” interest rate—sometimes called “r-star” or r* by economists—a celestial body which is supposed to demarcate the boundary between economic stimulation and restraint.
We are told that when the policy rate is below this nebulous neutral, monetary policy is “accommodative,” providing milk and honey to boost economic growth. Above the ethereal equilibrium, policy is said to be “restrictive,” holding back growth, employment, and inflation.
We can glean the Fed’s view of the neutral rate by looking at the projections of its officials for the longer run federal funds rate. A decade ago, the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) showed that the median forecast of the longer run fed funds rate was four percent.
This climbed downward as the Fed found that inflation consistently ran below its two percent target while employment was slow to recover from the 2008 financial crisis and attendant recession. There was a bit of volatility in the early Trump years as officials assessed that Trump’s economic policies might be boosting growth to a permanently higher level.
But in the summer of 2019, they dropped the longer run rate down to two percent. There it has hovered, dipping only once and never climbing, for nearly five years. This is extraordinary given the volatility of growth and inflation over this period. It suggests that 2.5 percent has become something of a fixed point in the turning world.
It’s important to note that the changes in the fed funds projection were not driven by changes in the expectation for longer run inflation. The Fed forecasts its target of two percent on inflation. Which is to say, it assumes that inflation over the longer run will bend to the will of monetary policymakers. What this means is that the Fed’s view of how much higher the Fed funds rate will be than inflation—the real rate, as they say—has come down and then stayed down.
The Fed’s View of Neutral Is Probably Wrong
If the Fed’s view is right, then the current stance of monetary policy is quite tight. The Fed’s current target range of 5.25 percent to 5.50 percent is 275 to 300 basis points above the neutral rate. To put it differently, the Fed professes to believe that the fed funds rate should, over the long run, be 50 basis points over the inflation rate to be neutral. In January, the top of the range was more than 300 points above the realized 12-month increase in the personal consumption expenditure price index the Fed uses to track inflation.
But here’s where the plot thickens, and the intrigue deepens. Despite the Fed’s belief that monetary policy is restrictive, the U.S. economy, that indomitable beast, was frolicking along at a robust four percent growth rate in the latter half of the previous annum. Forecasts for the current quarter oscillate with the unpredictability of a spring zephyr, yet they suggest a resilience that confounds the doomsayers.
Goldman Sachs said Monday that it expects the economy to grow 2.4 percent this year, with average payroll gains of 175,000, and a year-end unemployment rate of 3.8 percent. That’s not a description of an economy throttled by high-interest rates.
This is causing some to reconsider the Fed’s venerated “neutral” rate, that economic North Star, guiding the ship of policy through turbulent waters. This rate is purportedly the dividing line between stimulus and restraint, yet it eludes direct measurement, cloaked in the mystique of econometric models. Our central bankers have proclaimed for five years now that the longer run rate for federal funds is 2.5 percent, just half a point above their inflation target.
What if, some maverick voices suggest, this heavenly neutral rate has embarked on a celestial creep upwards, unbeknownst to the terrestrial beings below? This is what Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari has hinted at recently, perhaps feeling more able to speak freely because he is not a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee this year.
So, what could have caused the astral ascension of what the economists call r-star?
That’s a subject we’ll explore in tomorrow’s Breitbart Business Digest as we prepare for this week’s Fed meeting."
1e85822c-c49d-4690-81ed-aa705cf8c839,Did Biden Just Hand Hamas A Big Gift In Its War Against Israel?,"President Joe Biden told MSNBC during an interview on Saturday that Israel would be crossing a “red line” if its counteroffensive extended into Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza bordering Eygpt.
Israel sees a Rafah ground assault as vital to finishing off Hamas and winning the war; abstaining from it would only ensure the terrorist group’s survival and recovery, experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation.
“Biden is kneecapping Israel and determining how they should fight a war that they did not start,” Gabriel Noronha, executive director of Polaris National Security and former State Department official, told the DCNF.
President Joe Biden on Saturday warned Israel against invading Hamas’ remaining stronghold in Gaza, but experts say this would only ensure the terrorist group’s survival and recovery.
Biden told MSNBC during an interview that Israel would be crossing a “red line” if its counteroffensive extended into Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza bordering Egypt and a refuge for Hamas. Biden’s opposition to a Rafah ground assault would hinder Israel’s military options, allowing Hamas to bolster its defenses and embolden foreign adversaries around the world, foreign policy and defense experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation. (RELATED: Kamala Harris Calls For ‘Immediate’ Ceasefire At Gaza Strip)
“The defense of Israel is still critical,” President Joe Biden tells Jonathan Capehart. “But there’s red lines that if he crosses…cannot have 30,000 more Palestinians dead.” pic.twitter.com/0SAPJySAYS — MSNBC (@MSNBC) March 9, 2024
“Biden’s redline is misguided. He is in the process of abandoning Israel as he kowtows to the extreme left which seeks to protect Hamas terrorists who kill Israelis,” Mark Dubowitz, CEO of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the DCNF.
“It’s an inconsistent view to claim that you want security and peace for both Israel and Palestinians, while pushing for a policy that guarantees Hamas’ survival,” Gabriel Noronha, executive director of Polaris National Security and former State Department official, told the DCNF. “Biden is kneecapping Israel and determining how they should fight a war that they did not start and did not want.”
Biden does not want Israel to go into Rafah because it would threaten civilians and disrupt the region, potentially forcing Palestinians to flee into Egypt or elsewhere. He also claimed Saturday that 30,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war, appearing to reference casualty figures from the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry which routinely provides false information.
“The President of the United States is citing casualty figures from Hamas — a US-designated terror organization. That is inexcusable,” Shoshana Bryen, senior director of The Jewish Policy Center, told the DCNF.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to Biden’s comments on Monday and said Israel is going to push into Rafah regardless of outside opinions, telling Axel Springer, Politico’s parent company, that he has his own “red line” – ensuring events like the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks against Israel do not happen again.
The comments come during a time that there is a growing rift between the Biden administration and the Israeli government. The Biden administration is studying options on the creation of an independent Palestinian state and demanding Israel scale back its counteroffensive measures, which the Israeli government and Netanyahu have signaled is not possible. Netanyahu is also not acting solely on his own accord, but rather is part of a unity wartime cabinet comprised of both political allies and rivals.
Biden told MSNBC that Netanyahu is “hurting” Israel with his policies. “Biden tries to pretend that there’s Netanyahu, and then there’s Israel, and that they’re two separate entities that are at odds with each other. The reality is, Netanyahu is doing what the vast, vast majority of Israelis are demanding that the Israeli government do,” Noronha told the DCNF.
Roughly 75% of Jewish Israelis support a ground assault in Rafah, according to a poll from The Israel Democracy Institute published on Sunday. Roughly two-thirds of Israelis disagree with the Biden administration’s insistence on a scaled-back counteroffensive, in a separate poll from January.
Much of Hamas is cornered in Rafah and Israel has an opportunity to deliver a fatal blow. If Israel does not launch an assault in Rafah, Hamas could recover and continue to present a lethal threat to regional stability, experts told the DCNF.
“Israel has no choice but to go into Rafah, where four Hamas battalions and the Gaza-Egypt tunnels that resupply Hamas with weapons are still standing,” Dubowitz told the DCNF. “If not, Hamas will emerge victorious and Israel will be vulnerable to more Oct. 7’s as Hamas has threatened.”
“Rafah is Hamas’s last organized military and governing stronghold and it abuts the porous Egyptian border over which Hamas has been smuggling arms and equipment,” Bryen told the DCNF. “Without Israeli security control of Rafah and the border, Hamas can escape or rebuild.” (RELATED: Within 3 Days, Biden Does Total 180 On Gaza Ceasefire Prediction)

Dubowitz noted that if Israel does not go into Rafah and Hamas can regain its strength, it will signal to foreign adversaries and terror networks they can act aggressively without fear of consequence, specifically pointing to Iran, the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism and the mastermind behind over a dozen terror networks throughout the Middle East.
“[It will] embolden Iran-backed Hezbollah to escalate against Israel on the country’s northern border and Iran’s other terror proxies in Iraq, Syria and Yemen to threaten U.S. troops and international shipping,” Dubowitz told the DCNF. “Of most concern, it will send a message to Iran’s supreme leader that he can advance his nuclear weapons program without a response from a weak president who is focused on beating up America’s allies and appeasing America’s enemies.”
Netanyahu told Axel Springer on Monday that the Rafah invasion would be launched soon and hinted the counteroffensive could be wrapped within a month.
“We’ve destroyed three-quarters of Hamas’ fighting terrorism battalions. And we’re close to finishing the last part in warfare,” Netanyahu said. “[Fighting will not] take more than two months… Maybe six weeks, maybe four.”
The Israeli government is preparing to present a plan for the invasion and efforts to protect civilians in the region, in a bid to quell U.S. and international humanitarian concerns. The State Department said on Monday that the Biden administration will look at Israel’s plan when it’s ready and likely give an opinion of it.

Jeremy Medina, 17, was accidentally hit in the head by a bat in the cage during practice. He has been in a coma since November 20, according to Fox 5.
Dr. Michael Cormican, the director of Surgical Critical Care at Northeast Georgia Medical Center, detailed the devastating nature of the injury to Medina.
“The initial trauma to his head was significant and caused him to lose consciousness, and as he lost consciousness, he lost his ability to maintain his airway,” the doctor said.
In a press conference last month, Gainesville High School Principal Jamie Green stressed that no roughhousing or foul play was associated with the incident.
“As the player followed through on his swing, Jeremy leaned into the net and was struck in the head,” Green told reporters.
The life of Jeremy Medina will forever impact the lives of our entire community. His passing will mean renewed life for many others as an organ donor. Please continue to pray for the Medina family. Information about Jeremy's Honor Walk & Celebration of Life will be shared soon. pic.twitter.com/b1BuDP9LmA — Gainesville City School System (@GCSSK12) December 6, 2023
On Wednesday, Dr. Cormican revealed the heartbreaking news that Medina’s condition had worsened to the point of “death by neurological criteria, or brain dead.”
The doctor empathized with the pain Medina’s family must be experiencing.
“I’ve got a teenage son myself, and honestly, I can’t imagine the pain the family has had to deal with,” Cormican said.
But Jeremy’s father, David, relies on his family’s faith in Christ to get them through.
“I just want everyone to be sure that our strength, my family’s strength, my strength since day one has been and only been rooted in the most amazing power of Jesus Christ, our Savior, and our redemptor,” said David Medina.
David also thanked others for the many prayers of support his family has received.
“All these people don’t even know my son – don’t even know my family – but they are together with us in prayer and supporting us in this moment,” he said.
Jeremy had expressed his desire to have his organs donated in the event of his death, and the family will abide by his wishes.
“We are thankful and grateful for all the support that has been shared to the Medina family and to Jeremy,” said Jeremy’s uncle. Pastor Frank Medina. “Before his passing, Jeremy made the decision to give the gift of life by registering as an organ donor and tissue donor when he received his driver’s license.”"
acfe48bf-1dc5-48f6-94cf-77934d9478b2,What Even Is Black Mirror Anymore?,"No matter how you feel about Black Mirror—and opinions tend to cluster at opposite extremes of the spectrum—you have to admit it’s a brilliant title. As creator Charlie Brooker wrote when the series premiered on Channel 4 in 2011, “The ‘black mirror’ of the title is the one you’ll find on every wall, on every desk, in the palm of every hand: the cold, shiny screen of a TV, a monitor, a smartphone.” You stare into it expecting to see yourself and find only an abyss that might be your reflection filtered through technology. Our screens: dark and blank. Ourselves: same.
While genre conventions varied from one standalone episode of the anthology series to the next, and not every story took place in a dystopian future, Black Mirror could generally be described, in its first five seasons, as a science fiction show about the perils of technology. The tone was almost always grim, with endings that could make you feel viscerally ill and the black humor Brooker had honed while working on satires like Brass Eye and Screenwipe twisting the knife. But the world has changed in the past 12 years; in fact, few aspects of our global culture have changed as much as the intertwined industries of television and tech. And the show’s creator has, to his credit, realized that his sci-fi nightmares no longer have the same effect they once did. Black Mirror’s new, five-episode sixth season, its first since 2019, is very different from what preceded it. So different that it raises the question: What even is Black Mirror anymore?

In my mind, season 6 breaks down into three sections. The first two episodes, “Joan Is Awful” and “Loch Henry,” take on a contemporary screen phenomenon that must be at the top of Brooker’s mind: streaming entertainment. The last two, “Mazey Day” and “Demon 79,” are horror stories. That leaves episode 3, “Beyond the Sea,” a prototypical Black Mirror tear-jerker that casts Aaron Paul and Josh Hartnett as astronauts who are able to virtually visit their families thanks to a device that transfers their consciousnesses to look-alike robots back on Earth. “Joan Is Awful,” a five-minutes-in-the-future cringe comedy that follows a woman (Annie Murphy) who discovers that her daily life is being adapted into a streaming series starring Salma Hayek, is the only other story that evokes the uncanny tech-queasiness that used to define the show. And while “Beyond the Sea” takes place in an alternate-reality 1969, “Demon 79” is set in 1979 and “Mazey Day” in the early aughts. Apparently nostalgia is the new future shock.
It’s true that Black Mirror has broadened its scope over time. The tone became more varied after it moved to Netflix for its third season. Episodes like “Nosedive,” written by Michael Schur and Rashida Jones, and the breakout queer romance “San Junipero” explored a lighter side of tech-innovation hell. In 2018, the “interactive film” Bandersnatch offered subscribers a playable Choose Your Own Adventure novel. Most recently, the disappointing fifth season betrayed signs of fatigue with the whole Black Mirror concept, delivering sci-fi camp in the form of macho gamers who can’t stop making their VR avatars have sex with each other and a lonely teen who projects her obsession with a pop star onto a doll-like robot toy made in the singer’s image. (At least that episode yielded a hilarious fusion of Nine Inch Nails music and vapid pop lyrics.)

The intervening four years in the real world have provided no shortage of dystopian inspiration: a lethal pandemic, a crypto roller-coaster, the launch of ChatGPT and the subsequent AI panic. But Brooker, it seems, has grown weary of ripping from scary headlines. By setting so many episodes in the past, he explains in the season 6 production notes, “I didn’t have to think, ‘What’s the episode of Black Mirror about NFTs,’ which is an idea that depressed me greatly.” Instead, he “wanted to throw out some of the core assumptions of what a Black Mirror episode is”—in part because the format has been so influential. “When we started doing the show, there weren’t many dystopian sci-fi shows around. These days, you can’t hurl a smartphone across a room without hitting three dystopian sci-fi shows. With season 6, there has been a conscious effort to rip up the rule book, keep it unpredictable for viewers, and maybe expand its remit.”
The results of this experiment are mixed. On the plus side, the new batch of episodes is a major improvement over season 5. I had more fun watching “Demon 79,” which casts We Are Lady Parts star Anjana Vasan as a downtrodden sales clerk who accidentally summons a demon (Paapa Essiedu from I May Destroy You) and must commit three murders in order to prevent the apocalypse, than I have with any episode since “San Junipero” in Season 3. The retro-futuristic setting of “Beyond the Sea” evidently allowed Brooker to access the more poetic, emotional register that defined the show’s best early episodes. While I didn’t love the rest of the season—I’ve never been the show’s biggest fan—only “Mazey Day” felt like a waste of time.

It would be unfair, as well, to say that there’s no longer any unifying factor among Black Mirror stories. Flaws aside, the season’s sanctimonious paparazzi polemic “Mazey Day” and undercooked true-crime sendup “Loch Henry” both take aim at the mass media; as Brooker has pointed out, that sort of criticism has been baked into the show since the beginning. What even “Demon 79” shares with its predecessors is an arc that begins with a shift in reality as we know it and ends in a monster twist. Every episode at least dabbles in social commentary.
Are these few common threads enough? Brooker believes they are—and hey, it’s his show and he can do what he wants with it. “A Black Mirror episode can be whatever the hell we want it to be. There are no rules,” he insists in the production notes. “Part of the impetus for doing the show in the first place was to try to make something unlike anything else on television.” But here’s the problem: Black Mirror as currently conceived isn’t unique. It’s The Twilight Zone, which Brooker has cited as an inspiration since the beginning, and which has been airing, on and off, on American TV for more than six decades. Billed as a “Red Mirror presents” title, “Demon 79” could’ve been an episode of George A. Romero’s 1980s horror anthology Tales From the Darkside or Guillermo del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities, which is already on Netflix.
Maybe it’s silly to overthink this stuff. After all, how a show defines itself is ultimately less important than the quality of the stories it tells. And by the latter measure, Black Mirror is on an upswing. What gives me pause is the question of why Brooker would radically reconceptualize a series whose premise has exceeded its expiration date, instead of just moving on to a fresh idea. Should we blame Streamberry Netflix for clinging to a popular title? In that sense, I guess, Brooker is still staring into the void—a black mirror that is also, now, a gaping maw of content.

DENVER (AP) — Charlie Blackmon doubled in a four-run fifth inning, Jurickson Profar extended his on-base streak to 31 games and the Colorado Rockies spoiled 20-year-old Eury Pérez’s road debut with a 5-4 victory over the Miami Marlins on Tuesday night.
Elías Díaz had three hits for Colorado. The Rockies have won the first two of the four-game set between the 1993 expansion franchises.
The 6-foot-8 Pérez made his major league debut against Cincinnati on May 12 and beat Washington on Thursday for his first victory. The right-hander pitched well for three innings Tuesday at hitter-friendly Coors Field, allowing one unearned run, but faltered in the fifth.
He walked the leadoff batter, gave up an RBI double to Blackmon and walked Profar before leaving. Randal Grichuk had a two-run single off reliever Huascar Brazobán and Díaz scored on Ryan McMahon’s forceout.
“I was just trying to get a ball to the outfield,” Grichuk said. “I didn’t try to do too much.”
Pérez (1-1) allowed four runs — three earned — on four hits in 4 1/3 innings.
“Sometimes you can out-stuff the lower levels out here you can’t out-stuff and that’s why you got to get ahead,” Marlins manager Skip Schumaker said about Pérez, who throws his fastball 98 to 100 mph. “His fastball still plays up here. The offspeed plays better when you throw fastball strikes on strike one.
Blackmon has 298 doubles to pass Larry Walker for second on the franchise list. Todd Helton is first with 592.
“He’s amazing. He’s one of the best teammates I’ve played with,” Díaz said about Blackmon. “He works out, he’s healthy, his preparation is at another level. You watch him and it’s like motivation for yourself. He’s doing something all the time.”
Jorge Soler and Garrett Cooper homered and Yuli Gurriel had three hits for Miami.
Soler put the Marlins ahead in the first inning with his 13th home run, and the Rockies tied it in the third when Grichuk scored on a two-out single by Harold Castro.
Cooper’s two-run homer with two outs in the sixth inning, his fourth of the season, chased starter Austin Gomber (4-4). Soler’s RBI double in the ninth made it a one-run game, but Pierce Johnson closed it out for his 10th save.
“He got out of some pretty big innings,” Schumaker said about Gomber. “Credit to him getting some double play balls. We just couldn’t get that one big hit.”
TRAINER’S ROOM
Marlins: Transferred RHP Johnny Cueto (right biceps tightness) to the 60-day day injured list and selected the contract of outfielder Jonathan Davis. Miami also optioned OF Peyton Burdick to Triple-A Jacksonville.
Rockies: RHP Dinelson Lamet (back stiffness) is scheduled to make another rehab start with Triple-A Albuquerque on Friday.
HOMETOWN PRIDE
The Rockies celebrated the Denver Nuggets reaching the NBA Finals on front of their game notes. Each note was given a Nuggets-themed headline, from Denver’s playoff rallying motto “Bring It In” to “Sombor Shuffle,” which describes Nikola Jokic’s signature jump shot. Monday, Denver native and Colorado lefty Kyle Freeland donned a Jamal Murray jersey during batting practice.
UP NEXT
Reigning NL Cy Young Award winner Sandy Alcantara (1-5, 5.05 ERA) will be on the mound for the Marlins on Wednesday against Colorado rookie RHP Karl Kauffmann (0-1, 8.31).

PITTSFORD, N.Y. (AP) — Michael Block is supposed to work on Monday, just like nearly every other PGA club professional this time of year.
The 46-year-old’s daily routine at Arroyo Trabuco Golf Club in Southern California is a mixture of lessons and paperwork. It’s typically followed by an early evening visit from teenage sons Dylan and Ethan, aspiring golfers who can already blow it way past their dad off the tee.
Block wouldn’t have it any other way. The lure of being a touring professional vanished long, long ago. The appeal of chasing a PGA Tour card was heavily outweighed by a steady paycheck that lets him play and teach the game he loves without worrying about missing a mortgage payment.
Besides, there’s still room to dream. Room to have rounds like the one Block put together on Friday at the PGA Championship, when his name floated near the top of the leaderboard at Oak Hill surrounded by players far more famous.
Hitting balls with his “why not” personal mantra stamped on them and getting cheered at every turn by a gallery littered with some of the PGA’s 29,000 other teaching pros, Block fired a second straight even-par 70 to easily make the cut for the first time in seven tries at a major and check off the only real item left on his professional “to-do” list.
“I feel like I’ve got the game this week to compete, to tell you the truth,” said Block, later adding, “I feel like I could shoot even par out here every day. I feel like at the end of the four days that that might be a pretty good result.”
It certainly was after two days.
Block’s nearly four-hour tour of the East Course included three birdies in his first five holes, a stretch that vaulted him into second behind first-round leader Bryson DeChambeau. He knew he had it going before his touch briefly vanished on his closing nine. He bogeyed the par-5 fourth despite having a lob wedge in his hand on his approach. He followed by shanking an 8-iron off the tee on the par-3 fifth, when only a fortunate bounce off a limb prevented the ball from sailing out of bounds and into someone’s backyard.
Earlier in his career, it may have sent Block into a freefall. He doesn’t do that anymore. The instructor who tells his students the importance of “spiraling upward” shook off the ensuing double-bogey to par each of his final four holes. It forced him to cancel his scheduled flight back to California on Saturday morning.
Booking a flight home so early wasn’t so much about a lack of confidence but practicality. While Block believes he’s “pretty darn close” to the level of Cantlay and Hossler, he also knows he arrived in Western New York having never made the weekend in six tries at majors.
He has now. So easily it’s not difficult for Block to let the mind wander. While not the longest hitter — Block joked his 18-year-old son Dylan can blast it 70 yards by him — a driver switch at “oh dark 30” on Wednesday night has given Block enough length off the tee that he doesn’t have to hit mid-irons into the greens.
His putter is fine. His nerves, too. The fear that he didn’t belong out here vanished a year ago at Southern Hills. Playing a handful of groups ahead of a pairing that included Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy, Block shot a 2-over 73 in the second round.
“My (boss) even said, ‘That was you not being a club pro anymore,’” Block said.
It was meant as a compliment. Yet it’s also telling of how teaching professionals are often regarded, as good players to be sure, just not quite good enough to regularly go up against the world’s best.
It’s a path Block considered taking — albeit reluctantly — earlier in his career. At the urging of his inner circle, he went to PGA Tour qualifying school in 2007. He didn’t make it out of the second stage, a wave of relief washing over him when he headed back home to his young family.
Some guys are cut out for the tour. Some are better suited for passing their golf knowledge along to others while getting their competitive fix when and where they can. Block is a star in the Southern California PGA, where he’s been named the Player of the Year nine times in the last decade.
He knows the gap between himself and the millionaires he’s playing alongside this weekend is small. Yet he knows it exists. And rather than spending Dylan and Ethan’s childhoods trying to close it, he’s been home instead. It’s a tradeoff he’ll take every time.
Later this month, both Dylan and his dad will try to qualify for the U.S. Open at the Los Angeles Country Club just an hour up the road. If Block had spent the last 15 years trying to punch his PGA Tour card, who knows if father and son would ever get that moment?
Besides, the PGA still gives the backbone of its organization a chance to live the dream. Block made it to Oak Hill because he finished in the top 20 at the PGA Professional Championship.
He’s sticking around because ... why not?
“I’m going to compete,” he said. “I promise you that.”
Even if it means he’ll miss work on Monday.

The gambling industry witnessed a 50.1% increase in the fraud rate during the first quarter of 2022, highlighting the susceptibility of casinos to various security challenges. These challenges encompass fraud, scams, money laundering and other criminal activities, primarily due to the substantial sums of money in constant circulation within casinos.
In a recent example, a 23-year-old man was arrested on theft charges after he successfully robbed a casino in Vegas of over $1 million by posing as a casino owner. The alarming nature of these security concerns necessitates prompt action. Technological advancements can significantly bolster casino security.
1. Physical Security Breaches
Physical security breaches, such as unauthorized entry into restricted areas or theft of assets, pose constant challenges for casinos.
Casinos can invest in LiDAR-based perimeter intrusion detection (PID) systems to tackle this issue. These cutting-edge systems use lasers to gauge distances and form centimeter-precise 3-D point cloud images of objects. They can be strategically positioned at casino perimeters or key entry and exit points to identify and track intruders or individuals banned from casino premises.
Capable of functioning effectively in most weather and lighting situations, these systems can automatically move PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) cameras in the direction of a suspect and integrate with the casino's video management system (VMS) to track intruders at various points throughout the casino, enhancing security coverage.
2. Cybersecurity Threats
Casinos have shifted many of their operations online, and digital platforms can be targets for hacks, data breaches and other cyberattacks.
One prominent example is MGM, one of the world’s largest casino firms, which recently experienced a cyberattack, potentially costing the company an estimated $100 million.
To address these risks, casinos can leverage blockchain technology to facilitate safer financial transactions for online gamblers, minimize fraud and expedite financial operations through the security of its distributed ledger.
3. Identity Theft
Identity theft poses a significant challenge in casinos, where individuals may attempt to use false identities or manipulate identification documents to gain access, play games or engage in fraudulent activities.
Biometric authentication offers a potent solution by verifying individuals' unique physical or behavioral traits, such as facial recognition or fingerprint scans. This can ensure secure entry for legitimate players and safeguard their identities, as the unique nature of biometric data greatly reduces the risk of counterfeiting and unauthorized access.
4. Internal Threats
Internal threats, often involving employees, can compromise casino security and integrity. Employees may engage in activities like stealing money, providing information to outsiders or aiding in cheating schemes.
According to James Taylor, Chief of the Nevada Gaming Control Board's Enforcement Division, 25% of casino fraud arrests involve employees.
To safeguard against internal threats, casinos should implement thorough background checks during the hiring process and maintain vigilance over their employment period to spot potential red flags. Employing access control systems with biometric authentication and behavior monitoring software can also help identify unusual or suspicious employee activities in real time.
Furthermore, robust data analytics can detect anomalies in financial transactions or access patterns, flagging potential internal threats before they escalate.
5. Surveillance System Failures
It's not uncommon for tensions to escalate into violent fights in casinos. Equally concerning are intruders with malicious intentions who may carry weapons into casino premises. If there are any vulnerabilities in the surveillance systems, they can be exploited by such individuals to wreak havoc.
Upgrading existing casino surveillance systems with advanced AI-powered weapon detection technology offers a solution. These systems screen all entrants, detect threats and can integrate with existing access controls and VMS for comprehensive real-time threat detection across all camera feeds.
Moreover, modern weapon detection systems for casinos can often detect concealed threats while not alerting on cell phones and keys.
6. Money Laundering And Counterfeit Chips
Given the high volume of financial transactions, casinos can be used to launder money.
In 2022 alone, casino regulators in the U.S., the U.K., Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands issued over $264 million in fines to casinos, holding them responsible for their insufficient anti-money laundering controls, among other compliance failures.
To combat this, casinos can incorporate radio frequency identification (RFID) chips into each casino chip to gain real-time insights into the activity at the gambling tables. This can help them promptly identify and investigate any deviations from expected statistical outcomes and suspicious patterns or irregularities in the flow of money.
Integrating RFID tags into each casino chip offers a promising solution to the issue of counterfeit chips as well. Installing cashier booths equipped with RFID readers can help verify the legitimacy of tokens during cash exchanges, reducing the risk of counterfeit or unauthorized chip usage.
7. Human Trafficking
The large and transient nature of casino environments creates the perfect opportunities for traffickers to operate, utilizing the anonymity and flow of people for their illegal activities.
This problem can be addressed by installing visitor management systems in casinos to scan a visitor's basic identification at entry. These systems can then leverage the ID or license scanned to access vital information about the visitor, helping to identify potential threats and protect against human trafficking.
8. Underage Gambling
Approximately 60% to 80% of high school students engaged in gambling in 2021, with a subset at risk of developing significant gambling issues.
To combat underage gambling, casinos, both online and physical, can implement stringent age verification, requiring users to submit official identification documents or utilize biometric authentication methods for account access.
The Way Forward
The future of casino security is within the industry's reach, and it's a future that combines innovation, vigilance and a commitment to providing the best possible gaming environment for all.
Casino owners should consider adopting technological innovations to chart a safer course for the industry, along with these actionable recommendations.
• Prioritize employee cybersecurity training.
• Implement real-time AI monitoring.
• Develop emergency response protocols.
• Equip staff with safety devices.
• Regularly update security measures.
Adopting these measures can help shape a safer future for casinos everywhere.

The total number of immigrants in the U.S. rose to a record high of 51.4 million as of February 2024, representing 15.5% of the total population,according to CIS. The U.S. Census Bureau published projections in November which estimated that the share of foreign-born nationals in the U.S. would not reach 15.5% until at least 2039, making the projections “obsolete,” CIS authors Steven Camarota and Karen Zeigler wrote. (RELATED: Biden Considering Granting Amnesty, Handing Out Green Cards To Illegal Immigrants)
The 15.5% includes both immigrants who are in the U.S. legally and those who are undocumented or are in the country illegally, according to a CIS review of the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey (CPS). Illegal migrants account for roughly 25% of the 51.4 million total number of foreign nationals currently living in the U.S., the other 75% being in the country legally.
The number of U.S.-based immigrants grew by 6.4 million under the Biden administration alone, according to CIS. It is estimated more than half of the 6.4 million are illegal immigrants, which is larger than the individual population sizes of 33 different states.
“The enormous scale of immigration over the past three years has implications for nearly every aspect of American society, including public coffers, the labor market, schools, hospitals, and the balance of political power, to say nothing of whether we can assimilate this many people,” Camarota and Zeigler wrote in the study.
Roughly 2 million migrant encounters were recorded at the southern border in fiscal year 2023, compared to approximately 1.7 million in fiscal year 2021, according to Customs and Border Protection. Migrant apprehensions at the southern border never crossed more than 1 million under the former Trump administration.
“This increase over just 38 months (since President Joe Biden took office) is unprecedented,” Camarota and Zeigler wrote. “Looking at each presidency shows that growth since the start of the Biden administration is dramatically higher than the increase during Trump’s or Obama’s time in office.”
If current trends continue, the total foreign-born share of the U.S. population will reach roughly 60 million by the end of a second possible Biden term in 2028, according to CIS. At present, the number of immigrants in the U.S. is higher than at any point in American history.

Officials charged the suspect, identified as James Tolbert, 43, in August with felony shoplifting as he was on bail for another felony shoplifting case, CWB Chicago reported Wednesday.
A serial shoplifter who got released from jail thanks to the SAFE-T Act resumed his work, stealing from Sunglass Hut and Ulta Beauty locations downtown a dozen times, officials say.https://t.co/c5BxrkhVdo — CWBChicago (@CWBChicago) February 22, 2024
At the time, the man could not put up the $1,600 deposit for bail in order to be freed with an ankle monitor. However, a few weeks later the state scrubbed its cash bail system, and the suspect was allowed to return home under conditions set by Judge Kenneth Wadas that he must stay at his residence during the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.
Since that time, Tolbert has been accused of shoplifting or robbing two stores in the Loop and on the famous Magnificent Mile 12 times. He is currently behind bars.
Illinois eliminated cash bail in September, which was a move that brought heavy criticism, according to Breitbart News.
Meanwhile, social media users shared their thoughts on the CWB Chicago report, one person writing, “He didn’t learn his lesson? The voters haven’t either apparently.”
Prosecutors charged Tolbert on July 15 with shoplifting at an Ulta Beauty store on Michigan Avenue. Judge William Fahy released the man on his own recognizance but he did not show up for his court date and a warrant was issued for his arrest. The CWB Chicago article continued: The long arm of the law caught up with him on August 10. Prosecutors said he shoplifted from the same Ulta location. They said he walked in, grabbed a basket, went directly to the fragrances, filled the basket, and walked out.
Charged with felony retail theft and operating a continuing financial crime enterprise, Judge Susana Ortiz ordered him to pay a $600 bail deposit to be released on electronic monitoring, and the judge handling the July shoplifting case ordered him to pay another $1,000 deposit. He couldn’t raise the money.
It was not long before cash bail was eliminated across the state and Tolbert was released without the monetary conditions but was ordered to stay at home during those designated hours.
However, Tolbert was arrested on February 8 at a Macy’s where he allegedly walked out of the store with several pairs of sunglasses worth more than $2,000.
Moments later, on the street outside, he allegedly kicked a loss prevention agent, knocking her down. However, the woman’s partner was able to handcuff the suspect as they waited for law enforcement to arrive and take over.
Authorities reportedly found metal knuckles connected to a switchblade and a credit card that did not belong to Tolbert on his person. Officials eventually levied several charges against him.
The CWB Chicago report also noted Tolbert was accused of shoplifting from several Sunglass Hut stores in January.
“In court on February 9, Judge Ankur Srivastava decided that Tolbert would be released with a 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew on the new charges. But he detained Tolbert for violating pretrial release in the already-pending case until the judge handling that matter reviews the new allegations. Tolbert is due in court again today,” the outlet said.
Will County state’s attorney Jim Glasgow (D) previously criticized the Illinois law regarding cashless bail, stating, “It will destroy the state of Illinois,” Breitbart News reported in September."

Yale accepted about 4.5% of applicants last year, making it one of the nation's most selective universities.
At the same time, standardized exams such as the SAT have come under fire from critics who point out that higher scores are correlated with wealth, meaning that richer children tend to score higher than poorer ones, partly as high-income families can pay for tutoring, test prep and other boosts. But Yale said it decided to reverse its test-optional policy after finding that it may actually hurt the chances of lower-income applicants to gain admissions.
""This finding will strike many as counterintuitive,"" Yale said in its post.
During its test-optional admissions, applicants could still submit scores if they wished, but weren't required to do so. Yale found that its officers put greater weight on other parts of the application besides scores, a shift that the university found ""frequently worked to the disadvantage of applicants from lower socioeconomic backgrounds,"" it noted.
The reason is due to the fact that students from wealthy school districts or private schools could include other signals of achievement, such as AP classes or other advanced courses, Yale said.
In contrast, students from schools without deep resources ""quickly exhaust the available course offerings, leaving only two or three rigorous classes in their senior year schedule,"" Yale noted. ""With no test scores to supplement these components, applications from students attending these schools may leave admissions officers with scant evidence of their readiness for Yale.""
Providing a standardized test score, even one that's lower than the median SAT range for Yale students, can give Yale admissions officers confidence that these applicants can succeed at the school, it added.
Yale said its new policy will require that students submit scores, although they can opt to report Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) exam scores instead of the ACT or SAT.
Does wealth gain access?
The decisions of Yale, Dartmouth and MIT to require SAT or ACT scores come amid a debate about the fairness of admissions at the nation's top universities.
Last year, the Supreme Court ended affirmative action in college admission decisions, effectively ending the use of race as a basis for consideration in whether to accept an applicant. At the same time, critics have pointed out that top universities often provide advantages to certain types of students who tend to be wealthy or connected, such as the children of alumni who have an edge over other applicants through legacy admissions.
The ""Ivy plus"" colleges — the eight Ivy League colleges along with MIT, Stanford, Duke and University of Chicago — accept children from families in the top 1% at more than double the rate of students in any other income group with similar SAT or ACT scores, an analysis found last year.
There's a reason why so many people are focused on the admissions policies of Yale and other top colleges: the Ivy-plus universities have collectively produced more than 4 in 10 U.S. presidents and 1 in 8 CEOs of Fortune 500 companies.
For its part, Yale said its research has found that test scores are the single best predictor of a student's grades at the university, even after controlling for income and other demographic data.
Still, the school added that it will continue to examine other parts of a student's application, noting, ""Our applicants are not their scores, and our selection process is not an exercise in sorting students by their performance on standardized exams."""

Among students, 56% expressed concern about their reputation being damaged because of someone misunderstanding something they’ve said or done, according to the survey. The survey also revealed that attempts to de-platform speakers that students don’t like at the worst five campuses for speech had an 81% success rate and that de-platformings are on the rise on campuses, with 52 incidents in 2022, up from 36 in 2021. (RELATED: Colleges — And Students — Took An Axe To Free Speech In 2022. Here Are Some Of The Worst Examples)
“Some of the most prestigious universities in our country have the most repressive administrations. Students should know that a college degree at certain schools may come at the expense of their free speech rights,” FIRE Director of Polling and Analytics Sean Stevens said in a press release.
Among students, 26% said they censor themselves a few times a week in conversations, and 25% said they’re more likely to censor themselves than they were when they started college, according to the survey.
The top five best colleges for free speech were Michigan Technological University, Auburn University, the University of New Hampshire, Oregon State University and Florida State University, according to the survey. The bottom five worst colleges were Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of South Carolina, Georgetown University and Fordham University, according to the survey.
“Each year, the climate on college campuses grows more inhospitable to free speech,” Stevens said in the press release.
The survey was conducted by FIRE and College Pulse, a survey research and analytics company, and surveyed over 55,000 students at 248 colleges and universities around the country, according to the press release.

ab7e4378-3264-480e-b99c-e9c4b29f8959,7 Things You Probably Don’t Know About The 4% Retirement Withdrawal Rule,"The 4% rule seems so simple. Multiply your savings by 4%, and that’s how much you can spend the first year in retirement. After that, adjust your spending by the rate of inflation. It’s simple, right? Not so fast.

While many people nearing retirement have heard of the 4% rule, few have read the 1994 paper that gave us this rule. Read it carefully, and you’ll learn some surprising facts about this ubiquitous retirement rule of thumb.
1. It Only Applies To A 30-Year Retirement
William Bengen, the author of the 1994 paper, evaluated 30-year retirements. He looked at 51 one of them, starting from 1926. For shorter retirements, the safe withdrawal rate goes up. For longer retirements, it goes down. It’s up to each of us to determine how long our retirement plan should be.
As an example, Charles Schwab calculates that for a 20-year retirement, one could start with a 5.4% or higher initial safe withdrawal rate. For early retirees with a 50-year planning horizon, Vanguard puts the SWR at 3.3%, depending on a number of variables.
The key is to recognize that the 4% rule is sensitive to longevity.
2. It Assumes You Pay No Investment Fees
Bengen didn’t account for investment fees. For those who manage their own portfolio of index funds, fees are near zero. But for those with an expensive investment advisor who charges 1% of assets under management, it’s a different story.
A 1% fee reduces a retiree’s spending by 25% the first year. For example, on a $1 million portfolio, a retiree can spend $40,000 the first year using the 4% rule. Because of the fee, however, $10,000 of this amount must go to the investment advisor. If they’ve put the retiree’s money in expensive mutual funds, as is so often the case, the results are even worse.
It’s worth noting that the effects of a 1% fee change over time for a retiree. Why? Because while the spending amount turns on inflation irrespective of portfolio values, the 1% fee ignores inflation and is based exclusively on portfolio values. Either way, investment fees lower, sometimes significantly, the 4% SWR.
3. It Requires A 50% To 75% Allocation To Stocks
Bengen examined stock/bond allocations ranging from 100% bonds to 100% stocks, in 25% increments. What he found is that the best results (i.e., 4%) require a stock allocation of between 50% and 75%. If less than 50%, the portfolio struggles to handle long bouts of inflation. If more than 75%, a 1929-style stock market crash derails the portfolio.
In a second paper published in 1996, Bengen suggested the ideal stock allocation was 63%. Keep in mind, however, that there were other assumptions he had to make in that paper to arrive at this number.
4. Different Asset Allocations Change The 4%
Bengen used the S&P 500 to represent stocks and intermediate U.S. Treasury bonds to represent bonds. In later work, he considered other asset classes, including international stocks, small cap stocks and cash. Using these and other asset classes, he more recently concluded that the SWR is 4.7%.
The point is that the SWR depends, in part, on the specific asset allocation chosen by the retiree. Here it’s worth keeping in mind that all of these conclusions are based on historical data. The future is uncertain.
5. It Represents The Worst-Case Scenario
The 4% rule is not based on averaging the results. Bengen looked at 30-year retirements with starting years from 1926 to 1976. The 4% rule comes from the worst outcome from these 51 retirement periods—1966 to 1995. For those who retired in any other year, the SWR is higher. In some cases, it approached 10%.
6. It Assumes Your Spending Never Changes
The 4% rule results in a retiree having the same after-inflation spending each year in retirement. Most retirees, however, don’t spend the same after-inflation amount in their 90s that they spent in their 60s. Studies have found that we spend less money as we age through retirement, even accounting for higher medical expenses.
There’s even a term for this observation—the Retirement Spending Smile.
7. You May Die Broke (Or Wealthy)
Bengen defined success based on whether any amount of money remained after 30 years. Thus, if $1 remained in the portfolio after 30 years, he counted the results as a success. The same is true if the hypothetical retiree in his study had $6 million left after 30 years. And that’s pretty close to the actual range of results.
A person retiring in 1966 finished 30 years with virtually no money left. Another person retiring in the early 1980s had six times the starting portfolio value after three decades.
Conclusion
As simple as the 4% rule seems, there is a lot of complexity. It’s for this reason that a robust retirement planning tool is so important for those in or near retirement."

4f2880c2-6c38-4fd7-9300-4320aaec89b9,"Family Devastated After Brothers, 2 and 6, Both Diagnosed With Dementia","Following a terrifying diagnosis, one family is having to come to terms with the fact they may only have a limited number of years left with their two boys, who will struggle with seizures, slow development and childhood dementia due to a rare disease.
When Kristian Tucker, 31, and Bryden Tucker, 34, welcomed their third child in 2021, they relished life as a new family of five. But when their eldest child, Michael, now 6, started showing signs of delayed speech and seizures, the bubble began to burst.
Kristian Tucker, from Spokane, Washington, told Newsweek that Michael's seizures began at age 3 and ""continued to get worse as he got older."" Medication wasn't working, which left the doctors perplexed as to what the condition could be.
In February, the results of a genetic test led to a devastating diagnosis which resigned Michael to a short and difficult life, marred by development delays, loss of motor skills, and a cognitive decline resulting in dementia at an early age.
""After the genetic test, we were told that Michael has Batten disease type 2 in April 2023. We had never heard of it before, but I was horrified. When we first found out about it, we were told the average life span is about eight to 12 years,"" Tucker said. ""I couldn't believe that I might only have a couple of years left with my baby and that he would suffer so much.""
L: Michael, 6, is pictured holding onto his younger brother, Oliver, 21 months. R: The Tucker family together. They found out earlier this year that both and Oliver have Batten disease. Kristian Tucker
What Is Batten Disease?
Batten Disease is a group of nervous system disorders that start during childhood that can also be referred to as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN). The fatal disease has many forms, but it's categorized by the presence of a CLN gene which leads to the disorder. The symptoms of the disease can vary for each case, but they often include the loss of vision and eventual blindness, seizures, movement disorder and childhood dementia.
A child's development can be heavily impacted by Batten disease, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Skills such as standing, walking, and talking may never be accomplished, or the child can lose their abilities over time.
'I Still Don't Understand How They Can Have This Disease'
The diagnosis was shocking for the Tucker family, but they had no time to think about the repercussions before they were hit by the next blow. Michael's two siblings, Talia, 4, and Oliver, 21 months, also had to be tested for the condition as it's not uncommon for the disease to affect multiple siblings.
It's estimated by the Cleveland Clinic that Batten disease affects about three in every 100,000 births in the United States, but siblings of children with the disease have a 25 percent chance of also having the disorder.
In May 2023, a month after discovering Michael's fate, the Tucker family was devastated once again to find out that Oliver also has the gene.
Michael (L) and Oliver (R) were diagnosed with Batten disease in 2023. Batten disease has many forms, but it can lead to loss of vision, dementia and mobility issues. Kristian Tucker
""I felt broken. These are my baby boys, the sweetest, happiest little boys. I still don't understand how they can have this disease. It has devastated us all, but we are trying to make sure the boys have the best life we can give them by filling their little lives with experiences and family,"" Tucker said.
""So far the only developmental issue they have had is with their speech; Michael seems to have more severe speech delays than Oliver. Oliver can only say a few words, and Michael was diagnosed with apraxia prior to his diagnosis, and he still struggles a lot with his speech. The only other symptom Michael has is the absence seizures,"" she said.
""Neither boy has shown any signs of dementia, and we hope to have years before that happens.
""We don't really know, but the doctor thinks that the boys will have more time than we usually see, based on how some of their test results have come back. We feel as if the ticking time bomb that is this disease just got a longer wick, but we're also reminded that it's still a bomb.""
After the shock diagnoses revealed that two of their children have the cruel disease, the family is considering whether going through treatment would be the correct decision. While there is no treatment or cure for Batten disease, the Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of cerliponase alfa, which is an enzyme replacement therapy. The process involves inserting a port into the child's brain and then injecting the enzyme they're missing directly into the brain.
The treatment can be used on children over the age of 3 to slow down the loss of movement and physical ability. It isn't an easy call for the Tucker family to make, though, as they explained that it's an ""invasive treatment"" which isn't without its risks.
""It's such a struggle and it's something we are deciding with the doctors if the benefits out way the risk and potential harm,"" Tucker told Newsweek. ""But if it gives them more time for a potential cure or something to stop these symptoms, I think that might be what is best for them. But we are still deciding.
""If we go forward with treatment, we hope Michael's seizures will stop getting worse and that we can slow, or even stop, the loss of mobility,"" she said. ""However, it won't stop him from losing his eyesight or from the childhood dementia from happening. With Oliver, we hope it will prevent him from ever having seizures, but again, it won't stop the rest from happening.""

'There Is Often Very Little We Can Do'
Dr. Josh Bonkowsky is the chief of the pediatric neurology division at the University of Utah Health and Intermountain Primary Children's Hospital. As the hospital covers a five-state region, Bonkowsky has come across cases of Batten Disease personally, telling Newsweek they see ""one or two newly affected children.""
""Unfortunately, for most types of Batten disease there are no treatments that have been proven to work,"" he said. ""Families and their physicians are all very dedicated to finding options, but so far it is very limited.
""For Batten disease caused by CLN2, there is a treatment with an infusion of the missing enzyme, directly into the fluid space inside and around the brain. This is a complicated process and requires a pediatric neurosurgeon to perform a surgery to place a special port that connects to this fluid space where the enzyme is delivered.
""This infusion has to happen at least every other week. The enzyme treatment is expensive and time-consuming, has some risk of possible infections, and stops or slows the disease, but is not a complete cure.""
Having seen the devastating effects that this ""terrible disease"" can cause, Bonkowsky added that until there is a cure, ""there is often very little that we can do.""
""The most important thing to help a family with the disease is to be there for them. The disease and treatment journey can be frightening, but knowing that you are not doing it alone makes a big difference,"" he said.
""We are at the point where the technology and science have advanced to make treatment and cures a real possibility. We have an opportunity, by supporting children and families, and by supporting children's hospitals and their physicians and scientists, to make it curable.""
'We Want To Get The Word Out And Raise Awareness'
In June, the family opened up about their experience by creating a Facebook group called Michael and Oliver's fight against Batten Disease. They aim to create awareness for the condition, which very few people even know about.
Tucker said: ""This is such a rare disease, so we want to get the word out and raise awareness. We are hoping that maybe we can get opportunities that may prolong and improve their lives.
""One of the most rewarding things about putting our story out into the world is that more people know about the disease than before. We do hope to connect and hear the stories from others going through this, but right now, hearing others' struggles, seeing what is waiting for our boys in the coming months and years is still too terrifying, too raw.""

Utah's record-breaking winter may have worsened Salt Lake's mosquito scourge this summer — but in the long run, temperatures here are becoming less accommodating to nature's deadliest pests.
What's happening: The number of ""mosquito days"" — those with the hot and humid weather the flying insects crave — has trended downward in Salt Lake City over the past several decades, per a new analysis, Axios' Alex Fitzpatrick and Kavya Beheraj report.
The report, from nonprofit climate science research organization Climate Central, defines a ""mosquito day"" as one with an average relative humidity of 42% or higher, plus daily temperatures of 50°–95° F.
By the numbers: Salt Lake City was trending toward 23.7 mosquito days in 2022, almost 18 days fewer than in the late 1970s — a decrease of 43%.
Yes, but: Utah's wet year has made this summer abnormally accommodating to mosquitos, with some urban traps catching more than four times the average number of mosquitoes for the past five years on July 1, according to data from the Salt Lake County Mosquito Abatement District.
Chart via Salt Lake County Mosquito Abatement District
Why it matters: Mosquitoes are more than just a nuisance — they're a public health threat, carrying diseases such as malaria, West Nile, Zika and more.
The latest: West Nile virus was found this week in mosquitos in Davis and Uintah counties.
For the first time in 20 years, malaria has been spread by mosquitoes in the U.S., with local infections reported last month in Florida and Texas.
The big picture: 71% of the 242 locations Climate Central analyzed saw an increase in mosquito days between 1979 and 2022, of about 16 days on average.
Yes, but: Some locations — particularly in the South — are actually getting too hot for mosquitoes, the analysis notes."
a82fb3de-45b5-4e3f-9ee9-9ae98f77fd54,The Physics Of An Unusual Music Instrument And Duck Herder Shelter,"Duck herders in Java have been using a traditional large bamboo object called a kowangan to protect themselves against the rain. The kowangan can be worn as a hat or be placed on the ground as a portable shelter. But add a few strings and bamboo tabs and the kowangan turns into a bundengan – one of the world’s rarest musical instruments.
While most other musicians try to keep their instruments dry, bundengan players don’t mind a bit of rain. In fact, they often deliberately wet the instrument before playing and Gea Oswah Fatah Parikesit of Universitas Gadjah Mada in Indonesia has studied how water changes the sound of the bundengan.

Parikesit has been studying the physics of the bundengan for several years, and last week presented the group’s latest findings at the Acoustics 2023 conference in Sydney.
The resonator of the bundengan (the traditional kowangan structure) is made by covering bamboo splits with bamboo culm sheaths, the outer protective layers found on growing bamboo stems.
“Our team discovered that the key to the sound quality is in the bamboo culm sheaths,” Parikesit told the Acoustical Society of America. “To understand the physics of the sheaths, we first had to understand its biological context. When the sheaths were still attached at the bamboo stem, they gradually change shape: First, they are curled because they need to protect the younger parts of the stem, but afterward, they have a more planar shape because they no longer need to protect the older part of the stem.”
As the sheaths change shape when wet, this affects the acoustics of the instrument. Parikesit’s group studied the mechanics of the culm sheaths under wet and dry conditions and found that the forces of the culm sheath on the bundengan’s overall structure were different enough that it would explain a noticeable change in sound quality.

There are not many bundengans left today. While several researchers are working on various historical and musical aspects of this unique instrument to try to understand and preserve it, Parikesit’s research group specifically focuses on the physics of the instrument’s acoustics. In one of their earlier studies, they found that the acoustics of the bundengan sounds better for the player inside of the instrument than for others listening from outside the shelter.
Even though the bundengan is meant for personal use, it still sounds good when listening to recorded performance, such as this one by Pak Munir, who is likely the last remaining expert bundengan player in the world.
By studying the acoustics of the bundengan, Parikesit and other researchers hope to learn more about this instrument
“As an Indonesian, I have extra motivation because the bundengan is a piece of our cultural heritage,” Parikesit said in a statement for the Acoustics 2023 meeting last week. “I am trying my best to support the conservation and documentation of the bundengan and other Indonesian endangered instruments.”"

465e44b2-db1c-4dc1-94b2-1676e2866c00,Owen Tippett snaps tie in 3rd period as Philadelphia Flyers beat Blues for 4th straight victory,"ST. LOUIS (AP) - Owen Tippett scored the tiebreaking goal with 5:33 left, sending the Philadelphia Flyers to a 4-2 win over the St. Louis Blues on Monday night.
The surging Flyers won their fourth straight and swept their three-game trip through Minnesota, Winnipeg and St. Louis. Philadelphia has won five of six overall.
Tippett got the puck after a turnover at center ice, split the St. Louis defense and used a quick backhand-forehand move to score his 16th goal of the season on his 10th shot on goal in the game.
""It was just one of those ones that kind of opened up,"" Tippett said. ""Obviously, was looking shot first, but the (defenseman) kind of stood up and made himself small and I was able to kind of get around him.""
Flyers coach John Tortorella likes what he is seeing out of Tippett, who has four goals in his last five games.
""I said the other night, if he hits the net more, he'd probably have five or six more goals right now,"" Tortorella said. ""He's one of those athletes that develops on his own and he has a chance to be a really good player.""
Joel Farabee added an empty-netter with 53 seconds remaining.
Scott Laughton and Ryan Poehling also scored for the Flyers. Carter Hart made 28 saves to improve to 6-2-3 in his last 11 starts.
Oskar Sundqvist and Brandon Saad scored for the Blues, who finished a 1-2-1 homestand. Joel Hofer made 38 saves.
""I think we got what we deserved,"" interim coach Drew Bannister said. ""For 40 minutes, we didn't have enough effort in our game in hard areas. We continue to mismanage the puck. That is making it difficult on our team. We have to defend, which makes it easy for them. More offensive zone time, more shots at the net.""
After a scoreless first period, Laughton beat Hofer at 1:03 of the second to snap a 10-game goal drought. A turnover in the Blues zone created an odd-man rush and Garnet Hathaway's shot caromed off Hofer's pad right to Laughton's stick for a wide-open rebound shot.
Sundqvist's power-play goal evened it at 18:19. Brayden Schenn, playing in his 900th career game, used a toe drag to get off a quick wrister that created a rebound opportunity for Sundqvist.
""I think off the rush, we tried to find late guys and stuff like that,"" Schenn said. ""They backcheck hard, nothing was there and we didn't play below the top of the circles enough and work them down there.""
Poehling showed off some impressive hand-eye coordination to regain the lead for the Flyers. Egor Zamula's shot bounced off Hofer's pad into the air, and Poehling swatted it off Jordan Kyrou and into the net to give Philadelphia a 2-1 lead with 6.2 seconds left in the second.
Saad got a lucky bounce of his own to tie it at 1:18 of the third. Poehling had lost his stick and Schenn's centering pass hit the stick, essentially teeing up the puck for Saad.
""They tie it up and sometimes you can go either way, especially after a long trip, a long number of days here,"" Tortorella said. ""I thought our guys went the right way. They just kept on playing.""

8976fd81-f2e7-4791-a821-d10a54899167,ABC correspondent,"Americans still deeply love Princess Diana, says an ABC News expert.
Ahead of King Charles’ coronation on Saturday, ABC News’ Deborah Roberts gave her take on why many aren’t over the rocky relationship Charles, 74, had with Diana, who died in 1997 in a car crash.
The Emmy-winning Senior National Affairs Correspondent told Radio Times that people still “hold a grudge” against the monarch for how he treated Diana, according to the Mirror.
Charles infamously had a longtime affair with his now-Queen Consort Camilla while he was still married to the Princess of Wales.
Roberts, who is married to “Today” show host Al Roker, believes that Camilla, 75, “took Diana’s place next to the king on the throne.”
“Charles is a man who a lot of people associate with breaking Princess Diana’s heart, and Camilla is going to be referred to as Queen, not Queen Consort,” she went on. “[Charles] is austere and a little bit standoffish – his mother [Queen Elizabeth] was, too, but we didn’t have a lot of female heads of state around the world when she was ruling.”
Roberts also gave her thoughts on the royal family dynamic after Prince Harry revealed bombshells in his memoir, “Spare.”
“The royal family are just as messed up as any other family and we kind of like seeing that,” she said.

Roberts has covered royal events such as the Queen’s funeral last September, her Platinum Jubilee in June as well as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s 2018 wedding.
A poll was conducted recently and revealed that the majority of young Brits are “not interested” in the royal family and believe that Charles is “out of touch.”
The BBC enlisted the survey through YouGov to determine how the United Kingdom felt about the monarchy despite the family’s various scandals.

About 78% of adults — ranging from ages 18 to 24 — were very uninterested.
For adults ages 25 to 49 (64%), a little over half of Brits 50 to 64 (53%) and 42% of those 65 and older didn’t care about the coronation or the royal family.
More than half (54%) of British people think that the royals are “good value” for the money that citizens provide them.

Harry, 38, and Markle, 41, shook up the monarchy when they stepped back from royal duties and made the move to Montecito, Calif. in 2020.
While the Duke of Sussex will be attending his father’s crowning on May 6, his wife will not join him, as she will be staying home with the couple’s kids’ Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.
A separate survey was commissioned by The Standard in January, which found that most Brits wanted Harry to appear at the enthronement.
Sixty percent of adults hoped that Harry would journey to the U.K., with 30 percent of people desiring that he stay home in California."

CORAL GABLES — Eli Zied is one face of Florida's future.
The University of Miami senior started his own clothing brand while in high school. On Thursday, he had set up a pop-up store to sell his wares emblazoned with his brand name ""Habits.""
""Through this brand, people can look to become the best version of themselves,"" he said.
While building his brand though, he wonders if he can stay here long-term because his rent has skyrocketed.
""I feel the future can be uncertain because the cost of living is crazy,"" Zied said. ""Especially here.""
It was a sentiment voiced over and over inside the building next to his pop-up store.
Florida's Future conference was held -- delving into the topics of education, justice, commerce and housing. And, a big part of the discussion was over the escalating cost of living in South Florida and how that impacts all walks of life.
Judge Nushin Sayfie, a panelist on the justice session, remarked, ""We are one of the most expensive places to live in the country.""
Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez-Rundle added that new law school graduates are attracted to work in her office until they look at the average rents, which can top $36,000 a year.
""The legislature gives us 61 thousand dollars (per lawyer for salary) with law school debt of 164 thousand dollars"" she told the audience.
Listening to everything, Daniel Perez, the in-coming Florida speaker of the house, says he gets all the angst over the ballooning cost of living.
""I'm seeing friends leave and I don't want to lose talent,"" he told CBS News Miami.
Perez says lawmakers last session did help struggling families with tax breaks, and money for affordable and workforce housing. He says relief is on the way for property insurance.
""My homeowners went up 120%! Right now, the average increase is 14% but over the next 8 months, I predict the increase will be cut in half,"" Perez said.
That's just about the time Eli Zied will be graduating from the University of Miami.
He says a lot of factors are in play when deciding if South Florida will be his permanent home.
""Of course I want my clothing brand to blow up, but even then it's super expensive and prices are still going up,"" he said. ""So, it's uncertain in terms of that."""
810cf115-0696-446b-9352-4a21437869e9,Acapulco’s recovery moves ahead in fits after Hurricane Otis,"ACAPULCO, Mexico — The 58-year-old woman, a cook by profession, toiled on a recent afternoon inside a luxury apartment with expansive views of the Pacific, putting Gucci and Dior shoes into a bag to take to her employer. Around her only the apartment’s skeleton and piles of debris, walls and windows stripped by Hurricane Otis, remained.
But Rufina Ruiz was optimistic. Her house, in a suburb near the entrance to Acapulco, only flooded, while homes in the adjacent neighborhood were “buried.” And she still has a job, even though that meant she was not home when the government census of the hurricane’s victims was taken, which would have translated into aid. “I’d rather work,” she said.
More than two weeks after Otis went from tropical storm to Category 5 hurricane in a record 12 hours, catching authorities and residents flat footed, this city of 1 million, a blend of big hotels and impoverished suburbs, tourism and drug violence, is trying to recover at a similarly unequal rhythm.
Cars can again drive down the city’s main streets past rubble and felled palm trees. Signs around the city read “free food.” There are lines everywhere: for water, food, access to pharmacies.
Acapulco’s wealthiest residents, who fled either before Otis or immediately after, began to return to take stock of their seaside properties.
Along Acapulco’s coastal boulevard that encircles the bay once bobbing with yachts, a young man pulled tables and chairs out of a small restaurant. Nearby, workers nailed boards over broken shop windows.
Soldiers and National Guard troops fill the central streets, easily outnumbering the once ubiquitous palm trees.
Some residents complain that authorities didn’t provide more information about what was coming. Even those who heard Otis had become a Category 5 hurricane didn’t understand what that meant.
Mariel Campos, who lives in one of Acapulco’s poorest hillside neighborhoods, used to work at a hotel. She says she was offered to keep her job — cleaning up debris instead of making beds — but she turned it down because she would have paid more than half of the $16 a day she made for skyrocketing transportation costs to and from her damaged home.
Officially, at least 48 people were killed by Hurricane Otis and dozens more remain missing. Otis damaged 80% of the hotel infrastructure and 96% of businesses in a city that lives mostly from tourism even though it has lost some of its luster in recent decades as organized crime tightened its grip.
The federal government earlier this month announced a $3.4 billion reconstruction plan with aid for families, small business owners and hotels and says basic services have been almost completely reestablished. On Thursday the government of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador declared an end to the emergency.
“It’s outrageous that they think living in these conditions is not an emergency,” said Ana Mextlitzin Méndez, a 44-year-old psychologist, whose neighborhood, away from the tourist corridor, still has no power.
Neighbors around the city have organized themselves to pile branches and open paths through the streets, but they haven’t been able to remove all of the debris. In some places they burn it, while other streets remain blocked.
Humanitarian organizations like Doctors Without Borders have warned of the potential for illness like dengue and many of the damaged hospitals are full. The humid air is heavy with dust and mosquitoes are everywhere.
Méndez recognized that the government can’t do everything on its own, but she said residents need some guidance, something they haven’t received.
The losses are astronomical, but so was the fear, at least in the early days after impact.
“You heard gunshots, screams,” said 36-year-old Alci García, who had to move his wife and 2-year-old daughter out of the city as soon as he could because his daughter got sick. Without electricity, water, food or security, it became “save yourself,” he said. They still haven’t returned to Acapulco.
Daniela Fiesco, 40, concedes that she was among residents who took what they needed from stores right after the storm. She ran for water, milk, food for her dogs and took all she could carry. But then she was also among her neighbors who organized themselves to make barricades on their street and watch each other’s backs.
“They said people were breaking into homes and everyone panicked,” she said. “It was really crazy.” Young men armed themselves with sticks and machetes. She thinks the city fell into a “collective hysteria.”
There were also gestures of solidarity that often arrive before any government aid.
A community kitchen opened in front of Fiesco’s house that only just shut down a couple days ago.
High up on a hillside above the port, Alejandra Hernández sheltered several neighbors’ families on Oct. 25 when Otis hit because her in-laws’ house was one of the few made of concrete in the poor neighborhood.
Very few cars make it through the neighborhood’s steep, narrow streets with the exception of the famous — and now ancient — Volkswagen Beetles, affectionately known as “vochos.”
Here, where the Acapulco bay stretches out before residents, the only aid to arrive has been from private citizens or churches, said Victorino Justo Bolaños, from the site where his house stood. Now there’s just a concrete room and a bit of ground where a kitchen used to stand. But along with the kitchen, the roof and wooden walls blew away.
Nearby a couple of teens found one positive thing amid the destruction. Watching their homemade kites dive and soar, 16-year-old Anthony Sánchez said, “now that there are no wires we can fly.”"

145a123a-d480-4bd8-a879-13ab326052ab,Takeaways From a Feisty DeSantis-Newsom Debate on Fox News,"This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME’s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.
The event was billed by some as a 2028 preview but it was more of a bizarro version of 2024—one where neither Donald Trump nor Joe Biden were running for a second term.
In that alternate reality, it turns out, we would all be arguing a lot more about the pandemic.
""You were not following science. You were a lock-down Governor,"" Florida Governor Ron DeSantis told California Governor Gavin Newsom Thursday evening.
So much of the current political landscape can be traced to the national trauma of 2020’s Covid-19 pandemic and its fallout. Now almost four years on, the reverb continues to define political identity and ambition for two Governors with national aspirations and inclinations to be bullies. As DeSantis, who is running for President right now, and Newsom, who is not, clashed on Fox News, it was clear that their divergent approaches to pandemic was evidence in miniature why both men have a loud following among their parties’ partisans and why they rankle their detractors.
“I had Disney open during Covid and we made them a fortune and we saved a lot of jobs. You had Disney closed inexplicably for over a year,” DeSantis said of the popular theme parks in each of their states.
Newsom had a retort at the ready, noting that DeSantis had actually engaged in mass closures and other limits in 2020 until the Republican base had clearly sided with Donald Trump’s nothing-to-see-here approach. “You should apologize for your Covid record,” Newsom said. “You were with [Anthony] Fauci. You aligned with vaccines. You aligned with CDC guidelines until you didn’t. Tens of thousands of people died.”
DeSantis countered that he saw the light. “When we opened schools we bucked all of those people in June of 2020. He kept the schools closed for a long time,” DeSantis said.
The mutual enmity between the two men is as apparent as it is helpful to their national ambitions. Ultimately, neither of these men is particularly likable. DeSantis seemed like he was trying to get familiar and find his footing in a 2024 campaign that is slipping through his fingers, while Newsom seemed indifferent to public opinion of his smugness. Neither, though, is yet a viable nominee in the current environment.
DeSantis smirked through Newsom’s thumping, reduced to Trumpian staccatos of “lies” and “false.” DeSantis, whose presidential campaign is struggling by every objective measure, spent his time defending his tenure as Florida Governor and making the case that his version of conservatism is the future of the nation, while California is an outlier of American values and priorities.
“You’re trolling folks and trying to find migrants to play political games to get some news and attention so you can out-Trump Trump. By the way, how’s that going for you, Ron? You’re down 41 points in your own home state,” Newsom said.
DeSantis, who has made the culture wars a hallmark of his tenure as Governor and his platform for President, asserted that President Joe Biden is in cognitive decline and should step aside as the leader of the Democratic Party. “That’s why he’s running a shadow campaign,” DeSantis said of the man to his left.
Newsom declared he is not running for President in 2024 and again repeated that Vice President Kamala Harris is the obvious heir should Biden become incapable of running for a second term. “Joe Biden will be our nominee in a matter of weeks,” Newsom said. “It’s not even an option.”
At another point, Newsom corrected DeSantis’ pronunciation of Harris’ name: “By the way, it’s not Kah-mah-la Harris. Shame on you. It’s Comma-la Harris, Ron. Madame Vice President to you.”
The evening chugged along as the two men interrupted and stammered over each other. With DeSantis consistently chasing far-ahead frontrunner Trump and Newsom serving as a loyalist defender of the current White House, the Californian couldn’t help but to tweak DeSantis and his lagging campaign. “There’s one thing that we have in common: Neither of us will be the nominee for our party in 2024,” Newsom said dryly.
“When are you going to drop out and at least give Nikki Haley a shot to take down Donald Trump?” Newsom jabbed as the evening lurched to a close beyond the agreed-upon time limit. “She laid you out.”
“You wish,” was all DeSantis could summon.
DeSantis was clearly not ready to acknowledge the reality of the political landscape and instead kept his eyes trained on his immediate debating rival. “Gavin Newsom did huge damage to people in California. He ruined livelihoods,” DeSantis said. “We reopened the state very quickly. We saved thousands of jobs. We saved hundreds of thousands of jobs, thousands of businesses. We had our kids in school. He had kids locked out of schools because of the teachers’ unions.”
Host Sean Hannity, who struggled to keep the men on stage there in Georgia in check and listening to their counterparts, at times ready to cede control of the conversation.
“You’re nothing but a bully,” Newsom said as DeSantis kept interjecting with impunity.
“You’re a bully,” DeSantis shot back like they were on a school playground and not a national stage.
“You intimidate and humiliate people,” Newsom said. “By the way, how well is this campaign going for you?”
DeSantis largely ignored the taunts and instead kept hammering Florida’s supremacy over California. While he kept making the case for his nomination—now or in 2028—the night was unlikely to change DeSantis’ polling or fundraising as he chases the 2024 nomination. But Newsom, who is laying the groundwork for a 2028 campaign, kept dinging DeSantis as a relic.
“You want to bring us back to a pre-1960s world. America in reverse,” Newsom said.
For his part, DeSantis seemed ready to go in the opposite direction, to run the clock ahead to 2028, when both men could end up the nominee. But it’s entirely obvious the events of 2020 won’t be far from their planning.

Kenny Choi reports. (6-26-23)"
bb04551b-ea71-4bb5-9e11-ab7b7995908f,"This prayer is 'not comfortable,' but the Stations of the Cross help bring hope during Lent","The Stations of the Cross, also called the ""Way of the Cross,"" or ""Via Crucis,"" refers to the devotional prayer practice that commemorates the events leading up to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.
The ancient prayer began when pilgrims to Jerusalem began retracing the actual steps of Jesus Christ in Jerusalem. It ""invites us to accompany Jesus on the road to Calvary and reflect on 14 of the most profound moments leading up to His death,"" Sarah Shutrop, a writer at the Christian prayer app Hallow, told Fox News Digital via email.
As the practice spread, it became commonplace to install paintings or sculptures of these 14 Stations of the Cross in churches, said the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.
CHRISTIAN AUTHOR SAYS LENT IS A TIME OF LOVE, NOT LEGALISM
While some denominations use slight variations of the 14 stations, the intent of the prayer is to encourage meditation on the last moments of Jesus Christ.
""Like the good thief crucified next to Jesus, this prayer forces us to look upon Him, innocent and offered up for our sake,"" said Shutrop.
She continued, ""Following Jesus as He makes His way to death is disturbing. This is not a comfortable prayer.""
This discomfort, however, serves a purpose.
THE SURPRISING LENTEN HISTORY OF THE PRETZEL — AND ITS MEANING FOR THE SEASON
Thinking about Christ's death on the cross in atonement for the sins of humanity serves to ""challenge us by His example to be more loving, more generous, and more selfless in our response to the world around us,"" she said.
The act of praying the Stations of the Cross also invites Christians to pray with those who followed and knew Jesus.
""Many Stations bring us face-to-face with those who remained close to Him in His final hours. We encounter Mary, the Mother of Jesus, as she follows her Son on the way to death. We witness as Simon of Cyrene is forced to carry Jesus’ cross alongside Him. We meet Veronica in the Sixth Station, who risks her own comfort to bring comfort to Christ,"" she said.
WHAT IS LENT AND THE LENTEN SEASON, AND HOW DO CHRISTIANS OBSERVE THE TIME BEFORE EASTER SUNDAY?
The emotions felt by these figures are relatable during our own lives, said Shutrop.
A person could be struggling with grief, as Mary was, or supporting someone in need, as Simon did, she said.
""We might be called to courageously step out of our comfort zone — like Veronica,"" Shutrop also said.
""Wherever we may be, the men and women we encounter as we pray the Stations of the Cross offer us a blueprint for faithful discipleship, and serve to invite us to remain steadfast amid the shifting realities of our lives,"" she said.

The Stations of the Cross is a reminder of a ""hard truth,"" said Shutrop.
""We all suffer.""
She added, ""Each of us must pick up our crosses and push forward,"" just as Christ did before His crucifixion.
But, also, the Stations of the Cross are a reminder of another thing: hope.

2d697fb1-9662-4486-addb-716e666e2c8e,Jonathan Roumie on his faith and prayer life during Advent and always: TKTKTK,"In a phone interview with Fox News Digital on Monday, Los Angeles-based actor Jonathan Roumie spoke of his Christian faith, his prayer life and his hope that others may find peace and serenity during this Advent season of 2023 — because ""any opportunity to connect to Jesus is a welcome one,"" he said.
Roumie, perhaps best known for his role as Jesus Christ in ""The Chosen,"" has paired up with Hallow, the No. 1 prayer app in the world, for a special Advent prayer challenge for this holy season of preparation for Christmas. The 25-day prayer challenge began Monday — and as part of the effort, both he and actor Liam Neeson guide people through a variety of prayers, meditations, Bible readings and more.
This is no mere gig, however, for Roumie.
He is a committed Christian and Catholic, with his own personal story of growing closer to God and continuing to do so each day.
HALLOW APP ANNOUNCES COLLABORATION WITH LIAM NEESON FOR NEW ADVENT SERIES THIS YEAR
People can ""disconnect from the chaos of the real world, the divisiveness, the anxiety"" that exists, said Roumie, by connecting with Jesus through prayer.
They can find ""peace and a deeper relationship with Christ, and I think that's really the goal of the prayer challenge,"" he said.
Roumie said that building a habit of prayer ""is easier than people think.""
He added, ""As you consistently tap into that habit, you find your relationship with Jesus growing deeper and deeper, just automatically. And as a result, you then experience much more peace, tranquility and serenity in your life and the ability to really muscle through some of the most difficult obstacles and challenges that life can throw at you,"" he said.
Here is more of Fox News Digital's conversation with Roumie about the 25-day prayer challenge during Advent, which started on Monday — and about Roumie's own faith beliefs.
‘Deep gratitude’
Fox News Digital: In the midst of some of the most trying times today, how do you — and how does anyone — keep a focus on prayer, on God, on a connection with God? It's very, very easy to get distracted in today's world.
Jonathan Roumie: Yes, and I think that for me, I'm very easily distracted — and technology is one of the things that contributes to that distraction.
But in this case, I have such a deep gratitude to the technology that's arrived in the form of this app — of the Hallow app. I can literally go to my phone and if I find myself or my mind wandering — or my anxiety building — all I have to do is literally click on the app and just start praying or meditating on one of the challenges or one of the prayers.
FIRST SUNDAY OF ADVENT IS A REMINDER TO ‘WATCH’ AND PREPARE FOR CHRIST'S SECOND COMING, SAYS FAITH LEADER
There are thousands of prayers on this app. And I'm instantly transported into a sacred space, no matter where I am.
No matter what, if you live in a major city or if you live in a place that's just really busy, you can pop on your headphones and connect to the app. You start praying with a meditation and you're instantly just transported.
This is something that I've been so grateful for — and especially as we go into the hubbub and the busyness of the Christmas season, it's something that I'm relying on daily, to be able to just cut through all that noise.
‘Transformative for people’
Question: Are people reaching out to you about your involvement with the app and asking you more about it?
Roumie: I've had so many people say they've cultivated a relationship with Jesus through prayer because they heard me talk about the app, or because they watched ""The Chosen"" and then they started seeing this pop up in other places.
WHAT IS AN ADVENT AND WHAT DO ITS CANDLES MEAN DURING THIS HOLY SEASON?
And they've gotten introduced to the app and to a more deeply cultivated prayer life — and in some cases it's been absolutely transformative for people.
Some people who've never been to church started going to church. Some people who haven't been to church for 20 years have come back to the church. People have converted — and all because they've fallen in love with the richness, the depth and the tradition of the Catholic Church.
And obviously [the Hallow app] is authentically Catholic, but it is for all Christians — Christians of all denominations. There's something there for everybody, which is what makes the app so universally appealing.
‘Simple act of surrender’
Question: You've described an experience earlier in your life in which you prayed about leaving all of your anxieties and worries aside, and instead trusted that God would take care of things — and then after that came the role of Jesus in ""The Chosen"" for you. Is there a larger message here for people, things that others might learn from your experience?
Roumie: I think it all comes down to the simple act of surrender to God in a person's life. And I went through this in a very visceral, substantial and transformative way in my life five years ago.
I literally was on my knees and I said, ""Jesus, I surrender myself to you. Take care of everything."" And He did.
""It's a matter of tapping into [our] faith and allowing Him to be more involved in our lives — and surrendering is the first step to getting there""
And then three months later, I got called to do ""The Chosen."" It was a point that I think my life was building to when that happened — and I realized that trying to micromanage God was not something that was working in my favor.
'HALLOW' PRAYER APP ACCOMPLISHED ITS GOAL DURING THE GOP DEBATE, COMPANY SAYS: 'PRAY WITH ME REAL QUICK'
And once I let him take the wheel, everything changed. The decisive moment was that simple prayer of surrender.
And I think that's really difficult for people, especially when we feel so out of control. When we turn on the news and see what's going on today, it feels like we have no control in our own lives.
But God hasn't forsaken us. He's not abandoned us. He's faithful to us to the very end. And it's a matter of tapping into that faith and allowing Him to be more involved in our lives — and surrendering is the first step to getting there.
And then, to continue to cultivate that relationship through prayer — that's how we sustain that surrender.
The Hallow app and especially this Advent challenge is a beautiful way to kickstart that, especially if a person hasn't ever tried praying consistently before.
‘So many options’
Question: For those who haven't used it yet, can you describe how the app is not a replacement for Scripture but actually offers robust access to the Bible?
Roumie: I narrate most of the New Testament in the app, so you have access to the Bible here, through many works and passages of Scripture and through [other people] as well.
And if you want something that's very specific, it is here. Plus, there are resources for mental health.
There is music.
And for me as a musician, music is so transportive and nourishing for the spirit — to be able to listen to music that kind of gets you in the mindset for prayer and worship.
There are just so many options that people have that it's kind of mind-bending.
CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER
Question: How has playing the role of Jesus in ""The Chosen"" changed your life and changed you?
Roumie: It's allowed me to go deeper into my own relationship with Him.
It's caused me to examine what exactly is my relationship with Him — and how can I go further in that relationship, how can I get close to Him, how can I grow deeper in communion with Him.

So it's challenged me on that level.
But as it challenges me, it also allows me to go further in that relationship — and to deepen my prayer life."

The commission's final report repeated the same recommendation it made over a year ago, saying Massachusetts should get a new state motto and seal.
The commission did not reach any conclusion on what should replace the motto and seal.
The current seal on state flags dates back to the late 19th century. The seal has a depiction of a Native American man under a colonist's arm brandishing a sword. Those who oppose the seal say it is a reference to English colonists' cruelty to local tribes centuries ago.

Not only are they getting away with it, but the Biden administration and the other deranged actors on the far left are protecting them against parents who want it to end — the head of the U.S. education department, Sec. Miguel Cardona told the Associated Press he has no respect for the parents who passionately defend their students against these ideological attacks. “I don’t have too much respect for people that are misbehaving in public and acting like they know what’s right for kids,” Cardona said.

Adults who push “Drag Queen Brunch” or story hours at local libraries or stock elementary schools with sexually explicit materials are perverts. There is no sense in sugarcoating the obvious.

Our kids need to learn about building good moral character. Schools used to foster this in students by starting the day in prayer, saying the pledge of allegiance and sometimes reciting a school song. This routine grounded the students in faith and patriotism — teaching them to value God, their country and their community. (RELATED: ROOKE: Deion Sanders Epitomizes The Revival America Needs Right Now In Young Men)
Modern classrooms have an entirely different value system. If present at all, American flags are positioned in the far corner of the classroom. God, prayer and any form of Christianity were ripped out of school during the Free Love era. In its place, our students pledge allegiance to flags representing sexual preferences and fetishes outside of traditional life.
In a Sept. 12 Senate hearing, Republican LA Sen. John Kennedy read from two books — “All Boys Aren’t Blue” and “Gender Queer: A Memoir.” The words were so graphic Fox was forced to bleep almost every word of Kennedy’s monologue.
“I got a new strap-on harness today,” Kennedy read from “Gender Queer: A Memoir” by Maia Kobabe. “I can’t wait to put it on you. It will fit my favorite dildo perfectly. You’re going to look so hot. I can’t wait to have your cock in my mouth. I am going to give you the blowjob of your life. Then I want you inside of me.”

This is the material children are encouraged to engage with. It helps to desensitize them to sex and provoke risky behavior. Parents would go to jail if they took their 10-year-old child to a strip club, but for some reason, our society sees no issue with them sitting in a bar watching grown men fling their genitals around in a mini skirt. Drag shows are performative sex acts. Anyone suggesting children would learn to be more inclusive by spending extended time with men pretending to be women does not have their best interest in mind.
What on earth is “It’s not gonna lick itself” supposed to be referring to in this drag performance with CHILDREN in the audience?? They still gonna claim this stuff is just to educate kids on different identities? pic.twitter.com/oCMUDsTlOt — Megan Basham (@megbasham) June 5, 2022
It’s time they felt humiliated again. Our children aren’t given to us to be used for their sexual pleasure. We have an innate responsibility to protect them. In any other context, arrests would be made, and trials by juries of their peers would sentence them to prison. Every person born on this Earth has human dignity that should be upheld, but that does not mean sacrificing our children so that deviants can avoid feeling shame when they act out their sexual fantasies in public."

KDKA's Megan Shinn was live inside Party Cake Shop along Brookline Boulevard as they opened their doors for what's expected to be a busy day.
Customers were lined up when the doors opened at 6 a.m. and Party Cake Shop co-owner Zach Zebrowski told KDKA they expect to make at least 300 dozen paczki today as part of the long-standing Polish tradition for Fat Tuesday.
Zebrowski said his crew spent 12 hours working and preparing for the big day, detailing the long process of making and cutting the dough, frying, holing, and filling the paczki before they're ready to hit the display shelves.

The upcoming solar eclipse on Monday, April 8, will enthral skywatchers across North America. The very best views—by far—will be afforded only to those that have traveled into (or live in) the 115 miles wide path of totality that stretches from Mexico to Canada via parts of 15 U.S. states.
Visit Eclipse2024.org to simulate exactly what you'll see from any place in North America, and check your location on Timeanddate for exact timings and a full schedule.
Whether you are in the path of totality, where the sun is completely obscured by the moon, or elsewhere in North America, you can experience some or all of the eclipse’s phenomena.
Here's what to expect during the partial and total solar eclipse and how to safely observe it using solar eclipse glasses and other techniques:

3. Crescent Suns
Where: anywhere in North America
How: colander, spaghetti spoon, tree canopies
One sight worth looking for is the pinhole projection effect of tiny crescent suns projected onto your surroundings by anything with small defined holes. A kitchen colander or slotted spaghetti spoon works well. So do leaves on trees—look below them!
4. Shadow Bands
Where: path of totality only
How: a white sheet (or any uniformly light-colored surface)
A few minutes before the sun becomes totally eclipsed, you may see wavy lines on light-colored surfaces caused by the sliver of photospheric light that travels through Earth’s atmosphere.
5. Night Falls
Where: path of totality only
How: naked eye
As the eclipse is on the cusp of totality, daylight will fade by 10,000 times, and darkness will fall quickly. This is the moment you realize that you made a great choice coming into the path of totality—for the rest of North America, the eclipse is already over.

74b63756-1058-4de5-8d17-9f12c570852a,"Oklahoma, Texas seek final title","It's a season of transition in the Big 12 with Brigham Young, Central Florida, Cincinnati and Houston entering the league and Oklahoma and Texas playing their final seasons before departing for the Southeastern Conference.
The Sooners and Longhorns would love to ride off into the sunset with a final conference championship. History is working against them.
While Oklahoma has won or shared 14 championships in the 27 seasons since the Big 12 was established, they've failed to reach the championship game the past two years. Texas hasn't won the league since 2009.
The reigning champion is are Kansas State, and other contenders lurk in what is probably the most-balanced Power Five conference. There should be lots of unpredictability along the way.
A breakdown of all the teams entering the season:
1. Texas
Will the Longhorns finally end their Big 12 title drought in their final season in the league? There is enough talent in place with QB Quinn Ewers and WR Xavier Worthy capable of being one of the top passing combinations in the country. The only concern is finding a replacement for RB Bijan Robinson. LB Jaylan Ford should lead a solid defense that has gotten better each season under coordinator Pete Kwiatkowski. Texas still needs to find a way to win the close games.
2. Kansas State
While TCU made all the noise nationally in the Big 12, the Wildcats enter the season as the league’s reigning champions. The offense should see a bit of conversion with running back Deuce Vaughn gone and QB Will Howard's passing ability more featured. The running game is still in good shape with holdover DJ Giddens and Florida State transfer Treshaun Ward. The biggest hits for K-State came on defense. But Chris Klieman finds a way to win games and this season should be no different.

3. Oklahoma
How bad was the first season for Sooners coach Brent Venables? Oklahoma had its first losing record since 1998 and its worst loss ever to rival Texas. However, there is reason for optimism. The last four losses were each by three points, and a host of transfers on defense – especially up front – should bring massive gains to Venables’ area of expertise. QB Dillon Gabriel will likely be better after an inconsistent junior season, and a run in the Big 12 seems possible.
4. Texas Tech
It was quite the debut season for coach Joey McGuire as the Red Raiders knocked off Texas and Oklahoma. The trick will be to carry the momentum with QB Tyler Shough in control of the offense after three signal-callers saw significant time last year. Jerand Bradley has the makings of an elite receiver, and the offense should be one of the best in the Big 12. Defense is always a question mark in Lubbock, but the group quietly led the conference in sacks.
5. TCU
Sonny Dykes had one of the best debut coaching seasons in college football history by leading the Horned Frogs to the national title game. Now he must figure out how to navigate increased expectations with significant losses from last year’s group. Chandler Morris should slot in at quarterback for Max Duggan but finding replacements at running back and receiver won’t be as easy. Johnny Hodges and Josh Newton will be two of the best defenders in the Big 12.
6. Oklahoma State
Usually, a program as stable as the Cowboys doesn’t experience much upheaval. However, Mike Gundy’s team will see a lot of new faces in new places, starting with quarterback Alan Bowman, who arrives as a transfer from Michigan after Spencer Sanders held down the position for four years. The defense brought in coordinator Bryan Nardo, an unconventional hire, to fix a unit that was well below its usual standard.
7. Baylor
For a coach whose background is defense, the implosion on that side of the ball last season had to be particularly difficult for Dave Aranda. How quickly a fix can be found will likely determine whether last year’s slump was a blip or a trend. Also of concern is the need to rebuild an offensive line that was full of experience last year. RB Richard Reese shined as a freshman but he’ll need some help to create holes and quarterback Blake Shapen will need time to throw.
8. Brigham Young
After 12 seasons as a football independent, the Cougars return to conference play. The adjustment will be bumpy with serious upgrades needed across this roster. RB Aidan Robbins arrives from UNLV after a 1,000-yard rushing season and should anchor the ground attack. Another transfer solves the quarterback situation with Kedon Slovis joining from Pittsburgh. There’s talent on defense returning to work with new coordinator Jay Hill.

9. Central Florida
QB John Rhys Plumlee’s dual-threat ability makes the Knights difficult to defend, and the return of RB RJ Harvey and receivers Javon Baker and Kobe Hudson provide an excellent group of skill players to build the offense around. With scoring seemingly not an issue, the decisive area that will determine if UCF can contend in its new league looks to be defense. Tre'Mon Morris-Brash had six sacks to lead the team and could push for double figures.
10. Cincinnati
After making the College Football Playoff in 2021, the Bearcats took a step back last season and now must deal with a big cultural change after coach Luke Fickell left for Wisconsin. In comes Scott Satterfield, who failed to find big success at Louisville and now must transition his new school into the Power Five. His key move in the offseason was bringing in Arizona State transfer QB Emory Jones. Defense was Cincinnati’s calling card, and there’s a strong line with DL Dontay Corleone leading it.
11. Iowa State
Two years ago, Matt Campbell was a hot candidate for NFL jobs and the Cyclones were ranked in the preseason top 10. Things are much different after consecutive disappointing seasons and major uncertainty entering this fall. Returning quarterback Hunter Dekkers is part of a gambling scandal that has impacted multiple other starters. Their status for part or all of the season is uncertain.
12. Kansas
Not many teams would feel great coming off a season where they lost seven of their last eight games. But the Jayhawks famously started 5-0 and rose to No. 17 in the coaches poll before QB Jalon Daniels was hurt and missed three of the subsequent defeats. He returns with RB Devin Neal to form one of the Big 12’s best backfields that should key an explosive offense. Kansas may have to outscore opponents, however, after the defensive line took some big losses after a season where the team allowed 35.5 points per game.
13. Houston
The Cougars spent nearly 30 years hoping to return to a major conference and now have their opportunity to compete in a Power Five league. Donovan Smith, a transfer from Texas Tech, appears to the be the new starting quarterback and he’ll have Matthew Golden and a group of talented receivers to throw to in Dana Holgorsen’s offense. The defense had major departures, though after allowing more than 32 points per game that might not be the worst thing. Still, the unit needs to show improvement against a more difficult schedule.
14. West Virginia
The situation is simple for Neal Brown. He has to win games or he’s not going to make it until the end of the season as the coach of the Mountaineers. The path to success will be paved by an offensive line that includes Zach Frazier and several other veteran standouts. Who plays behind the unit is uncertain. The defense ranked 115th in scoring and needs to have major gains."
f07ca463-df0c-4265-8585-6cc3393aa7ea,Thames Water has failed us for four months after a flood,"Four months ago, a water pipe burst in our street and flooded the bathroom in our lower-ground-floor flat. The damage forced us to move out and we are still waiting for Thames Water and its insurer for a repair. When the burst pipe was discovered, the mains water was not shut off and it was five days before engineers came. By then, water had flooded a large area of the street and leaked through the light fittings in our bathroom. A dehumidifier made little difference and, three weeks later, we were moved into an apart-hotel while builders stripped the bathroom.
That was two months ago and no one has returned since. In the meantime, our landlord commissioned a survey, which recommended a programme of works, but repeated calls to Thames and its insurer have been ineffective. I suffered a miscarriage shortly after the flood, and believe severe stress was a factor. I am now seven weeks pregnant, and we are desperate to return home. Our 81-year-old landlord also had his health affected by the worry.
AH, London
Your log of interactions shows numerous calls and emails, most of which were either ignored, or asked you to wait for an update. Nonetheless, Thames Water claims it has been in “regular contact” and was unaware of your pregnancies. The most effective contact appears to have happened after I waded in. Contractors were appointed and you were told the work would take three weeks. You moved back four weeks later.
The company says initial delays were due to the complexity of the repair and council bureaucracy, and the water supply could not be shut off because of vulnerable residents in the street. The delays in repairing your flat, or confirming a timescale were, it says, because of the time it took to dry out. That doesn’t explain a month-long lapse between it declaring the bathroom dry and scheduling remedial works. Thames Water has agreed to pay £3,500 for the four months of rent you had to fork out on an uninhabitable flat.
Customers with problems should follow the company’s official complaints procedure on its website. If there is no satisfactory resolution, they can ask the Consumer Council for Water to intervene.

This is the fifth post in a series looking back at housing in 2023 and ahead to what 2024 might hold.
I ended 2023 even more firmly convinced that the Low Income Housing Tax Credit is the single worst housing subsidy ever created because it has done nothing to alleviate the systemic problem of housing scarcity, but it has made that problem worse, creating a self-perpetuating loop of housing inflation that has cost a generation of people earning less than median income an incalculable number of opportunities. Even worse, the LIHTC system has contributed to keeping rental housing inflation alive and with it, the notion that what’s needed to solve housing scarcity in the United States isn’t more housing, but more money. Is there any chance the LIHTC spell will be broken in 2024?
Simple answer? Like the question about changing public opinion in a previous post, the answer is, “Of course not!” In fact, if you’re reading this, the first paragraph is a pretzel of leaps and bounds that feel really wrong. If you’re a LIHTC person and part of that system, you might even be angry. “Made things worse? How can that be, when we’ve created thousands upon thousands of affordable units?”
Let’s walk through the LIHTC problem.
The Low Income Housing Tax Credit was created in 1986 as part of President Reagan’s tax reform proposal. It removed depreciation from the tax code for most housing development, but created a tax credit for private parties that would contribute to “affordable housing.” This would eliminate the incentive to let multifamily housing run down, and create and incentive to invest in subsidized housing. As Shelterforce explains, at the time, “LIHTC was seen by members of Congress as something that would be used by wealthy individuals to get tax breaks by investing in affordable housing.”
Over the years, though, the credits were repackaged, syndicated and resold, and a complex system of allocation emerged that I won’t try to explain here but have tried elsewhere. But let’s go back to the first paragraph. How has the credit made the problem worse? It’s simple. When local governments choke housing production with regulation, prices go up, people complain, and the federal government dumps tax credits on the problem. This habit, an addiction really, has empowered non-profit tax credit developers to put on a white hat as they chase tax credit equity issued by state housing finance agencies. So, when their projects run short on cash because of holding costs, high prevailing wage requirements, and multiple requirements to get LIHTC and other sources of funding, they ask for more money and usually get it.
This incentivizes inefficiency. Why fight absurd local zoning and land use restrictions when money, in the form of tax credits and other money, off sets those costs. And besides, local politicians love standing in front of a building and cutting a ribbon, no matter how much it cost or inefficient it is solving housing scarcity. In California, LIHTC projects can be as much as $1 million per unit. This price tag apparently doesn’t shock anyone. And local regulations and taxes continue because locals know that the federal government will always be pushing out more and more money.
I managed a small, 25 units, tax credit project. We were always struggling to collect rent. While the units rented lower than market rents, families still struggled with other costs like day care, transportation, and health care. They were working and paying, but sometimes rent had to wait. I think of these families often and how many thousands of them there are, benefiting from a roof over their head, but still struggling to pay rent. The tax credit has undoubtably housed millions of people, but how many more have felt the monthly squeeze in those projects and the many millions more that sat on waiting lists unable to benefit.
All along this process, for profit lawyers, accountants, consultants, and architects are making millions and probably billions. They wield tremendous power, shutting down any efforts at reform at the federal level. Early in 2023 I exposed the huge holes in data collection about where all the billions of tax credit dollars went. Behind the scenes, these interests were hard at work cajoling the congressional offices that started paying attention. We made some progress, but saw those small steps reversed.
In 2024, I don’t expect to see much movement on exposing the gross inefficiencies in LIHTC. As I look at the year ahead, my guess is the only option to short circuit the credit is to offer smaller success stories, maybe publicly funded cooperatives on community land trusts, as an alternative. If those kinds of solutions take off, the cracks may grow, and maybe, just maybe, a year from now, I’ll write about a new hope that the light at the end of the housing tunnel isn’t just another LIHTC train."

48d61969-7e82-4d16-8068-65e89e1dc880,Republicans panic about post-Mike Johnson meltdown,"Threats to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) are struggling to gain traction as his Republican colleagues fear the oblivion that would follow. Why it matters: House Republicans are vocal about not wanting to repeat last fall's chaotic, protracted speaker vacancy, with many acknowledging there may be no alternative to the current speaker.
One House Republican told Axios any vacancy would ""devolve"" into chaos, with ""nobody"" seen as prepared to step into Johnson's shoes.
""There is no one,"" the lawmaker said, warning that some centrist Republicans may even ""go with [Democratic Leader] Hakeem [Jeffries].""
State of play: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) introduced a motion to vacate against Johnson last month, the first step towards triggering a vote to remove him as speaker.
Greene has said a vote on Ukraine aid – which Johnson has pledged to hold – would be the catalyst for her to force a vote.
That Ukraine aid vote could come as soon as next week, GOP sources told Axios.
Republicans hold just a two-vote majority in the House, but Democrats have said they would likely rescue Johnson – especially if he held a Ukraine aid vote.
What they're saying: ""I don't see who could do a better job. I don't see who could get the votes needed ... to become speaker and then effectively lead,"" said Rep. Mark Alford (R-Mo.), calling removing Johnson a ""fool's errand.""
Rep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas), a member of the right-wing Freedom Caucus, said he is ""not in favor of getting rid of Johnson ... because nobody wants the job. Who wants the job? And who could do the job?""
Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.), the chair of the Republican Main Street Caucus, said he ""can't imagine a name of someone who would put us in a position to be successful if we vacated the chair a second time.""
""It would be, almost, a hopeless position,"" Johnson added.
The backdrop: Johnson, the former vice chair of the House GOP Conference, emerged as Republicans' lesser-known consensus choice after three of his more prominent colleagues failed to unify the party.
Johnson's ascension followed three weeks of infighting and internal gridlock as Republicans struggled to find a speaker nominee who could forge a 218-vote coalition out of Republicans' razor thin majority.
In the time since, Republicans' majority has grown smaller and their tensions have become more inflamed.
The other side: Greene told Axios, ""I think who can replace him is someone that's going to stand up against the Biden administration, not pass the Biden agenda so easily, not pass bills that require Democrat support."""
d37bd8ee-b567-4557-8228-53aa3ae4d374,Special Counsel Calls Biden ‘Well-Meaning Elderly Man With A Poor Memory’,"President Biden presented himself to interviewers as an “elderly man with a poor memory,” Special Counsel Robert Hur said in his report about his investigation into Biden’s retention of classified documents.
Hur declined to pursue criminal charges against the sitting president and described how Joe Biden willfully possessed classified information covering important national security matters, the special counsel report details. The report provides an assessment of how investigators perceived Joe Biden’s mental faculties.
“We have also considered that, at trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,” Hur’s report reads. (RELATED: Confused Biden Says He’s Recently Spoken With Yet Another Dead European Leader)
“Based on our direct interactions with and observations of him, he is someone for whom many jurors will want to identify reasonable doubt. It would be difficult to convince a jury that they should convict him-by then a former president well into his eighties-of a serious felony that requires a mental state of willfulness.”
Hur made the same assertions about Biden’s memory later in the report. The special counsel also described instances where the president forgot when he was vice president and the year his late son Beau Biden passed away.
Similarly, Joe Biden forgot significant details from the debate inside the Obama administration over the 2009 Afghanistan surge, which then-Vice President Biden notably opposed.
“I cooperated completely, threw up no roadblocks, and sought no delays. In fact, I was so determined to give the Special Counsel what they needed that I went forward with five hours of in-person interviews over two days on October 8th and 9th of last year,” President Biden said in a statement addressing Hur’s report.
“I just believed that’s what I owed the American people so they could know no charges would be brought and the matter closed.”
Everyone should look at page 384 (I know it’s a lot to scroll down) The inappropriate criticisms of the President’s memory are inaccurate, gratuitous, and wrong. We told the Special Counsel this. pic.twitter.com/Cr6VifBMnv — Ian Sams (@IanSams46) February 8, 2024
White House spokesperson Ian Sams disputed Hur’s account of Joe Biden’s memory and cited a letter the Biden administration sent his office contesting the assertions about the president’s memory.
“The inappropriate criticisms of the President’s memory are inaccurate, gratuitous, and wrong. We told the Special Counsel this,” Sams said on X.
President Biden is the oldest commander-in-chief in American history at age 81. His numerous gaffes and mistakes since entering the White House have generated considerable scrutiny and widespread concern from the public about his age."

Graham said, “It’s a systematic effort to destroy Donald Trump as a political person. His crime was he was a good conservative president.

You’re not gonna take the word of somebody that wants to borrow that kind of money. That’s insane.”
Graham said, “The judge has ruled that President Trump committed fraud and nobody got defrauded. The judge believes that Mar-a-Lago’s worth $18 million. What a friggin’ joke. Now, here’s what’s important to people watching this show. President Trump can’t be in Iowa and South Carolina and New Hampshire. But if you live in these states, you can help him by making sure that liberals do not get away with this. Vote for President Trump.”

ded0407c-a193-4f83-9a55-f741777ee032,Former FBI Official Linked To ‘Russiagate’ Probe Sentenced To 4 Years For Foreign Conspiracy,"A former top FBI official involved in the “Russiagate” probe into former President Donald Trump was sentenced on Thursday following charges of foreign conspiracy, The Washington Post reported.
Former FBI counterintelligence official Charles McGonigal pled guilty in August to aiding a Russian oligarch in exchange for secret payments, according to the Wall Street Journal. McGonigal was sentenced to approximately 4 years in federal prison and fined $40,000 in a Manhattan court, according to the Post. (RELATED: DOJ Declines To Prosecute FBI Official Who Went Rogue)
“I recognize more than ever that I’ve betrayed the confidence and trust of those close to me,” McGonigal said during his sentencing, according to the Post. “For the rest of my life, I will be fighting to regain that trust.”
McGonigal was initially arrested in January for his connections to Oleg Deripaska, a sanctioned Russian oligarch who he accepted payments from to collect open-source research against a rival, according to the WSJ. McGonigal was also charged for accepting $225,000 in payments from a former Albanian intelligence officer, which he is expected to face sentencing for in February 2024, according to Reuters.
“I have no patience or sympathy for this guy,” former FBI agent Jim DiOrio told the WSJ. “He saw an opportunity and he took advantage.”
McGonigal was involved in the Crossfire Hurricane probe, also known as the “Russiagate” probe, into the Trump campaign in 2016. Crossfire Hurricane turned into a 22-month, $32 million investigation that ultimately found no evidence Trump colluded with Russia to swing the 2016 election in his favor.
McGonigal was also involved in a “classified defensive briefing” that was given to the attorneys of failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2015, in what was called a “clear double standard by the Department of Justice,” by Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham in 2020.
Earlier in his career, McGonigal was one of two FBI agents who stopped a plot to bomb the New York City metro in 1997, according to the WSJ. He also helped in the FBI’s post-9/11 investigation and stayed in the city to work on a task force focused on foreign terror threats in New York City.
The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The world's biggest iceberg — which is roughly three times the size of New York City — is ""on the move"" after being stuck to the ocean floor for 37 years, scientists confirmed Friday.
Recent satellite images show the iceberg, called A23a, is now moving past the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula and headed toward the Southern Ocean, according to the British Antarctic Survey.
The iceberg, which spans almost 4,000 square kilometers (or 1,500 square miles) in area, split from the Antarctic coastline in 1986, but then became grounded in the Weddell Sea, the BBC reported.
The British Antarctic Survey on Friday posted a time-lapse of satellite imagery, showing the iceberg's movement.
""Here's its journey out of the Weddell Sea after being grounded on the sea floor after calving in August 1986,"" the survey wrote.
📣 Double-whammy iceberg news this morning:
1️⃣ The largest iceberg, A23a, is on the move!

Before its calving in 1986, the colossal iceberg hosted a Soviet research station. It's unclear why the iceberg is suddenly on the move again after 37 years.
""I asked a couple of colleagues about this, wondering if there was any possible change in shelf water temperatures that might have provoked it, but the consensus is the time had just come,"" Dr. Andrew Fleming, a remote sensing expert from the British Antarctic Survey, told the BBC. ""It was grounded since 1986 but eventually it was going to decrease (in size) sufficiently to lose grip and start moving.""
A23a will likely be ejected into what's called the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which will put it on a path that has become known as ""iceberg alley,"" the BBC reports. That is the same current of water that famed explorer Ernest Shackleton used in 1916 to make his storied escape from Antarctica after losing his ship, the Endurance. The legendary shipwreck was discovered off the coast of Antarctica just last year.

A23a's movement comes about 10 months after a massive piece of Antarctica's Brunt Ice Shelf — a chunk about the size of two New York Cities — broke free. The Brunt Ice Shelf lies across the Weddell Sea from the site of the Larsen C ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula. Last year, the Larsen C ice shelf — which was roughly the size of New York City and was long considered to be stable — collapsed into the sea."

Five of the victims were males, and one was a female, Megan Howard, Assistant Chief, Houston Police Department, said at a news briefing.
Police didn't release the names of the victims at the briefing. The University of Houston Athletics said in statement that Hayden, Ralph Oragwu and Zach McMillian — three former University of Houston football players — were among the victims of the crash.
""We extend our deepest condolences to their families, friends, and loved ones, as we collectively mourn the loss of three individuals who made an indelible impact on each life they touched,"" the university's statement said. ""While their combined talents provided Houston Football some of its most unforgettable moments, their unique legacies will best be remembered for the way they loved their teammates, supported their communities and defied the odds.""
Houston police received 911 calls around 2 a.m. local time alerting them to a major car crash involving ""two vehicles"" that included a black Chrysler 300 and a black Acura SUV, Howard said.
One of the cars driving at high speed ran a red light, and the driver of that vehicle has died at the scene, said Howard.
In all, four people died at the crash scene. One of those killed was a homeless man, Howard said.
An additional four people were transported to local hospitals, Howard said. Upon arriving at the hospital, two more people died, said Howard, and one patient, a female, has ""life-threatening injuries.""
Investigators are questioning a male patient at the hospital.
Hayden, 33, played for four NFL teams, the Oakland Raiders, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars and the Washington Commanders, CBS Sports reported. He starred as a defense back at Houston in 2011 and 2012 before joining the Oakland Raiders.
McMillian, 32, played for the Cougars from 2010 to 2013."
241a12e7-1259-4d0b-86b5-798c8e19b487,The Colorado ruling disqualifying Trump is already having an impact,"An important feature of the Colorado Supreme Court decision disqualifying Donald Trump from the ballot is that it still hasn’t taken effect, and it’s unclear when — or if — it will. By the state court’s own initiative, its ruling is on hold until Jan. 4, the day before Colorado’s primary certification deadline, and Trump can extend that hold by simply seeking U.S. Supreme Court review by then. So, the mechanics of that pause make it likely Trump appears on the primary ballot despite the state court decision that he can’t.
But that doesn’t mean the otherwise momentous ruling isn’t having an effect as 14th Amendment challenges proceed across the country. Look at Maine, where Secretary of State Shenna Bellows was set to decide this week whether Trump can be on that state’s ballot. She pushed the decision to next week, following the Colorado ruling. Maine’s Portland Press Herald reported that a spokesperson for Bellows, a Democrat, said the time change is due to the Colorado ruling as well as technical difficulties in the secretary of state’s office that have interfered with deadlines for the parties to submit briefs. (Unlike other state cases against Trump, Maine’s election official is deciding this one but it can be challenged in the state’s courts.)
At first glance, it’s unclear why a ruling in Colorado would have to affect a case decided in Maine or anywhere else. But the fact that the Colorado case already has such an impact, however slight, is a reminder of that power.
That’s because the Colorado justices laid out a detailed opinion addressing multiple issues in an unsettled area of the law that states across the country are grappling with. While it doesn’t technically serve as a binding precedent for other states, the Colorado ruling can serve as a guide for other decisions across the country, such as the impending one in Maine. Though the U.S. justices can have the last word, other states may look to Colorado for now.

Chicago Blackhawks rookie phenom Connor Bedard, the first overall pick in the most recent NHL Draft, has been placed on injured reserve after fracturing his jaw on Friday night.
Bedard took a hit to the face by New Jersey Devils' Brendan Smith midway through the first period. He left the game and never returned.

The hit resulted in the rest of the game being chippy. Even Devils' young sensation Jack Hughes laid out a big hit, and Smith dropped the gloves later on against Nick Foligno in the second period, right after multiple members of the two teams were in a dustup on the ice.
The Chicago Blackhawks also placed Foligno on IR with a fractured left finger, which he suffered in his fight with Smith.
The Blackhawks won the draft lottery last year, giving them the right to select Bedard.
NHL TEAM CALLS OUT TORONTO SUN FOR HEADLINE SLIGHTING GOALIE AFTER RECORD NIGHT: ‘BE BETTER’
He's lived up to the billing, leading the team - and all rookies - with 15 goals and 18 assists. However, it continues to be a rough go in Chicago, as they sit at 11-26-2 - their 24 points is the second-lowest mark in the league.
The Blackhawks have a laundry list of injured players, forcing themselves to acquire forward Rem Pitlick from the Pittsburgh Penguins for a conditional seventh-round pick in the 2026 NHL Draft.
Bedard has long been compared to Crosby, a future Hall of Famer, since he was in high school. In his NHL debut, he took the opening faceoff against his childhood hero.

It's unknown what Bedard's timeline is, although it seems reasonable he'll return for the All-Star Game next month, which he was selected to.
At age 17, Bedard led the CHL with 143 points in just 57 games, and led Canada to the World Juniors gold medal last year.

Owners are ""not expected to ratify"" Brady’s minority ownership in the Raiders during meetings Oct. 17-18 in New York City over concerns about the price at which Mark Davis, the franchise’s majority owner"" is selling it at, per The Washington Post.
The report cites a source saying Brady, who would be purchasing 5-10% of the franchise, wouldn’t be approved by the league’s finance committee at the price, which is considered a discount of up to 70%.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM
The source added that the purchase ""can’t happen at that price.""
It’s unclear if Brady would want to increase his bid for the minority stake to appease the finance committee. However, with Raiders ownership wanting Brady to own a part of the franchise, perhaps ""there’s a compromise"" possible.
Forbes’ most recent valuation of the Raiders has them at $6.2 billion. Brady needs 24 of the 32 NFL owners to sign off on the move before it can be locked in by the league.
TOM BRADY SET TO BECOME MINORITY OWNER OF RAIDERS, MARK DAVIS SAYS
Davis told ESPN in May that Brady was expected to purchase a minority stake in the franchise.
""We have come to an agreement for Tom Brady to become a partner in the Raiders, and we have submitted it to the NFL for approval. We’re excited for Tom to join the Raiders,"" Davis said in a statement.
The report from ESPN at the time said Brady wouldn’t have any ""operational control or authority over the club in business or football matters"" if he officially joined as an owner.
Brady was already making his presence known this year. He was in the Raiders' locker room ahead of a preseason matchup against the Dallas Cowboys talking to his former backup quarterback, Jimmy Garoppolo, who now starts for Las Vegas.
Brady also bought a stake in the Las Vegas Aces, the 2022 WNBA champions, in March.
Brady has been wanting to get into NFL ownership, and he reportedly attempted to purchase a minority stake in the Miami Dolphins in 2021 when he initially retired from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before second-guessing that decision.
The Dolphins were eventually punished by the league for engaging in communications they weren’t allowed to have with Brady because he was still under contract with the Buccaneers.

(Osceola County Sheriff’s Office via AP)
BUENA VENTURA LAKES, Fla. (AP) — A former city commissioner in central Florida accused of being a “ghost candidate” in a 2022 county commission race has been arrested on several campaign finance charges.
Former Kissimmee Commissioner Carlos Irizarry Sr., 67, of Buena Ventura Lakes, was arrested Friday on eight counts of willful certification of false or incomplete campaign treasure’s reports and six counts of deliberate failure to report campaign expenditures as required, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said in a news release.
State investigators said they began looking into Irizarry last year following allegations that he was paid to enter the Osceola County Commission District 4 race to affect its outcome. Kissimmee and Osceola County are located immediately south of Orlando.
After comparing bank records to Irizarry’s campaign treasure’s reports, inspectors said they identified a pattern of providing false information. In eight reports, Irizarry reported false campaign expenditures and lied about charitable donations made by the campaign, officials said. After the filing fee, Irizarry spent the remaining funds on personal items like day spas and restaurants, investigators said.
The term “ghost candidate” refers to someone who does little or no campaigning and only enters a race to siphon votes from one of the legitimate candidates.
FDLE officials wouldn’t say whether anyone else was involved in Irizarry’s candidacy scheme, but Jackie Espinosa, another candidate in Irizarry’s commission race, filed a lawsuit last fall accusing Irizarry of running to steal Hispanic votes and allowing the seat’s incumbent to win. The lawsuit was later dismissed, but an appeal is ongoing. No criminal charges have been filed against the incumbent.
The Office of Statewide Prosecution will prosecute the case. Jail records didn’t list a criminal defense attorney for Irizarry, and his civil attorney didn’t immediately respond to a message seeking comment."
6769752b-c04c-4acc-a117-2881e17af705,"OpenAi, John Hickenlooper, and everyone else wants to regulate and audit AI","Some legislators and experts are pushing independent auditing of AI systems to minimize risks and build trust.
Why it matters: Consumers don't trust big tech to self-regulate and government standards may come slowly or never.
The big picture: Failure to manage risk and articulate values early in the development of an AI system can lead to problems ranging from biased outcomes from unrepresentative data to lawsuits alleging stolen intellectual property.
Driving the news: Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) announced in a speech Monday that he will push for auditing of AI systems, because AI models are using our data ""in ways we never imagined and certainly never consented to.""
""We need qualified third parties to effectively audit generative AI systems,"" Hickenlooper said, ""We cannot rely on self-reporting alone. We should trust but verify"" claims of compliance with federal laws and regulations, he said.
Catch up quick: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed an AI Risk Management Framework to help organizations think about and measure AI risks, but it does not certify or validate AI products.
President Biden's executive order on AI mandated that NIST expand its support for generative AI developers and ""create guidance and benchmarks for evaluating and auditing AI capabilities,"" especially in risky areas such as cybersecurity and bioweapons.
What's happening: A growing number of companies provide services that evaluate whether AI models are complying with local regulations or promises made by their developers — but some AI companies remain committed to their own internal risk research and processes.
NIST is only the ""tip of the spear"" in AI safety, Hickenlooper said. He now wants to establish criteria and a path to certification for third-party auditors.
The ""Big Four"" accounting firms — Deloitte, EY, KPMG, and PwC — sense business opportunities in applying audit methodologies to AI systems, Nicola Morini Bianzino, EY's global chief technology officer, tells Axios.
Morini Bianzino cautions that AI audits might ""look more like risk management for a financial institution, as opposed to audit as a certifying mark. Because, honestly, I don't know technically how we would do that.""
Laura Newinski, KPMG's COO, told Axios the firm is developing AI auditing services and ""attestation about whether data sets are accurate and follow certain standards.""
Established players such as IBM and startups such as Credo provide AI governance dashboards that tell clients in real time where AI models could be causing problems — for example around data privacy.
Anthropic believes NIST should focus on ""building a robust and standardized benchmark for generative AI systems"" that all private AI companies can adhere to.
Market leader OpenAI announced in October that it's creating a ""risk-informed development policy"" and has invited experts to apply to join its OpenAI Red Teaming Network.
OpenAI released a paper Jan. 31 purporting to examine whether its models increase the risk of bioweapons. The company's answer: not really.
NYU professor Gary Marcus argues the paper is misleading. ""The more I look at the results, the more worried I become,"" Marcus wrote in his blog. ""Company white papers are not peer-reviewed articles,"" he notes.
Yes, but: An AI audit industry without clear standards could be a recipe for confusion, both for corporate customers and consumers using AI."

The Times of Israel reported Netanyahu as saying, in response to a question about Iran: “Iran is 50 North Koreas; it is not merely a neighborhood bully like the dynasty that rules North Korea … This is an ideological force that views us, Israel, as a small satan, and views you as the great satan — and to have Iran being able to threaten every city in the United States with nuclear blackmail is a changing of history.”
President Joe Biden has been attempting to revive the failed Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), under which Iran received sanctions relief in return for slowing the enrichment of uranium for several years. The deal allowed Iran to emerge as a nuclear power after about a decade, and did nothing about Iran’s missile program or its support for rogue regimes and regional terrorist organizations.
Netanyahu also warned the U.S. delegation about Iran using nuclear weapons to “blackmail” the West.
Separately, Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, warned that Iran has enough uranium for five nuclear bombs.

An early childhood education center on East 126th Street in East Harlem specializes in supporting them and other students with unique needs.
The Association to Benefit Children goes far beyond the ABCs. It appears to be all smiles in the program's Graham School, serving babies in bellies through 5-year-olds whose home lives look very different. Some have special needs, others just arrived in America, and almost all of them live in poverty. At ABC, they find freedom.
""After a few days, you could just see a whole transformation on them,"" said youth service director Jessica Casanova. ""It's like they feel so comforted and like they belong.""
""I let them know they're in a safe place,"" said special education teacher Zaida Villavicencio. ""I let them know I'm one of them.""
Villavicencio arrived from Mexico with her family when she was 7 and found herself at ABC after school learning English while staff cared for her three infant brothers upstairs. She is about to hit her 10-year anniversary working at the school and just received her Masters in special education.
""I had a kid last year who was only Spanish-speaking, and I honestly saw myself in her, just thinking back to when I first got here and how scary it was,"" Villavicencio recalled.
Co-founder and executive director Gretchen Buchenholz created ABC in the 1980s after she became an ""accidental witness"" to society's forgotten populations by walking into the wrong door one day.
""I came upon a room filled with plastic chairs and cribs, a room where homeless children and families were stored,"" she remembered.
Now, the publicly-funded program serves more than 3,000 families across the city, operating two dozen mental health clinics in public schools in addition to their own facilities, where they educate parents as well.
Erica Zarate Rodriguez's 7-month-old is her fourth child to attend ABC.
""They are exemplary young people,"" the mother said in Spanish, because of the support they have received at ABC. ""To everyone, infinite thanks.""
Rodriguez's two teens still come for after-school care, where backpacks filled with supplies waited for the students returning from summer break.
""That's where the therapy starts,"" said Graham School director Mary Ellen Rooney, ""just play, that's it. You know, we'll get to the other stuff, but just offer a safe space and build those trusting relationships.""
The elevated trains traveling back and forth inspire the little dreamers to chart their own future course.
In addition to public funding, the ABC program relies on up to $5 million in private donations each year.

The proposed merger raised concerns that Microsoft will become too dominant in the video game space, a fear Microsoft has attempted to mitigate through promises not to make franchises like Call of Duty exclusive to its consoles.
Microsoft owns the Xbox games console, as well as a number of highly popular titles including Minecraft, Halo, and Age of Empires. Activision-Blizzard also owns a number of blockbuster titles, including the Call of Duty, Overwatch and Warcraft franchises.
The merger cements Microsoft’s position as the second-largest video games company in the world, almost doubling its revenues in relation to Nintendo, and bringing it within striking distance of market leader Sony.

Microsoft swiftly closed the deal after receiving the nod of approval from the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), the last major regulator that had been standing in the way of the acquisition.
Via the Verge:
Microsoft’s $68.7 billion deal to acquire Activision Blizzard has been approved by UK regulators. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has concluded that the deal can proceed after Microsoft recently restructured the deal to transfer cloud gaming rights for current and new Activision Blizzard games to Ubisoft. The decision clears the way for the deal to close now that the UK regulator has given the green light. “The CMA has decided to give Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) consent to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc.

While the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has sought to block the deal, it was overruled by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit this summer. The FTC is appealing that decision, which raises the possibility of the U.S. regulator causing problems for Microsoft at a later date."

The self-employment boom we saw during the pandemic recovery seems to have fizzled out.
Why it matters: We're not in a YOLO economy anymore. The days of quitting your job to follow your dreams peaked in mid-2021.
Some of those efforts worked out — the number of people who formed an actual business employing themselves continues to rise. But in other cases, the self-employed effectively quit on themselves in order to take a job with an employer.
In May, the number of unincorporated self-employed Americans fell by 369,000. Many of them will have been among the 339,000 workers added to formal payrolls last month.
By the numbers: There are now 8.73 million Americans who are self-employed without owning their own company. That's down from a peak of 9.51 million in August 2021, and it's even lower than the 8.89 million registered in January 2020, before the pandemic hit.
Between the lines: Some of the fall might be attributable to the Hollywood writers' strike, notes The American Prospect's David Dayen.
The bottom line: When there are plenty of jobs to go around, Americans increasingly seem inclined to take one of them, rather than follow the dream of self-employment."

6398b612-b27d-42a7-a6fd-84ab31853520,'No sign of second-season syndrome',"Saveena Johal, Punjabi Forest, external
Five games into the season and three of our seven points have been gained on the road.Having arguably the most unfavourable start, the games we were dreading are (nearly) done with, and we are not downbeat.
Our away performances at Old Trafford, Emirates Stadium, and Stamford Bridge of last season pale in comparison to those we have just witnessed. Although we have continued to sit deep, we have then caused havoc for strong opposition teams.
A draw at Manchester City feels within our capabilities, but there appears to be enough quality in the team for us to have an exciting season whatever tomorrow’s result.
Taiwo Awoniyi has been consistently impressive up front, Ryan Yates gutsy as ever, and Ola Aina has looked a brilliant addition in recent games.
After Callum Hudson-Odoi’s decline at Chelsea, he has been a threat for us and if there ever was a man to help build his confidence and uncover his talent it would most certainly be our manager.
To cast our minds back to this time last year, four points accrued from seven games - with a painful goal difference - the breakthrough this campaign is crystal clear.
No sign of second-season syndrome.

CBS 2's Shardaa Gray reports it's a day where simply being a girl is enough to celebrate."
c9138aad-0426-419e-83c9-617a4eaca387,FBI Targets Muslims and Palestinians in Wake of Hamas Attack,"Federal law enforcement agents have questioned and detained Palestinian nationals and made visits to mosques in the wake of Hamas’s attack on Israel, according to civil rights advocates.
Abed Ayoub, executive director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, or ADC, said that his organization has fielded multiple reports of individuals and mosques being visited by the Federal Bureau of Investigation this week. The Stop LAPD Spying Coalition, a police accountability group, also said it had received reports of federal agents intimidating Palestinians and their supporters.
The interactions are reminiscent of surveillance and targeting of Muslim and Arab communities in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, and Ayoub told The Intercept that they are contributing to a resurgence of fear among Muslim communities. “Like, ‘Oh my god, this is happening again, how are we going to protect ourselves?’”
The reports come after President Joe Biden issued a warning this week about potential “domestic threats” across America. “This is not some distant tragedy – the ties between Israel and the United States run deep,” Biden wrote on Tuesday. “In cities across the country, local and federal law enforcement partners are closely monitoring for any domestic threats in connection with the horrific terrorist attacks in Israel.”
In a press call Thursday, Department of Homeland Security officials said they do not have any specific credible intelligence indicating a potential threat to the United States, but that they are monitoring “a variety of threat actors who might be driven by anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, or anti-Arab sentiment.” The officials also said they were monitoring potential threats in relation to a video statement by former Hamas political leader Khaled Meshal, who called for a broad, global mobilization in support of Gaza on Friday. Meshal’s statement prompted mass speculation and hysteria about a “Day of Jihad” across the United States, with schools in some places shutting down.
Ayoub said that the reports that the ADC received included FBI officers visiting a Texas mosque to meet with leadership and ask about any “troublemakers” in the community, and FBI agents seeking to question an individual who was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement two months ago for a green card issue. That individual, Ayoub said, “has never had any issues” prior to his run-in with ICE. Ayoub added that the ADC received a report of the FBI visiting a mosque in a different state from a partner civil rights organization.
The FBI declined to specifically comment on The Intercept’s questions about the reported visits. “The FBI can never initiate an investigation based solely on an individual’s race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or the exercise of First Amendment rights,” an agency spokesperson wrote in an email.
ICE deferred questions to DHS, its parent agency, which did not respond to a request for comment.
Human rights attorney Azadeh Shahshahani told The Intercept that greater surveillance and targeting of Muslim and Palestinian community members wouldn’t come as a surprise — and is rather a part of a pattern of federal law enforcement practices. “We get contacted by community members, saying that the FBI has come to their house without any type of prior notice or any type of prior suspicion, or any reason whatsoever, other than the fact that they’re Muslim or Palestinian or Iranian.” These visits often take place in response to an event happening somewhere in the world, Shahshahani said, or simply because the FBI is engaging in a “fishing expedition.”
Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at Democracy for the Arab World Now, or DAWN, said it was important to consider federal targeting of Palestinians in the context of broader U.S. policy on Israel–Palestine. “The U.S. government is not only sending more weapons to kill Palestinians in Gaza; it is going after Palestinians here at home,” he said. “With thousands of Palestinians killed and injured this week by the criminal apartheid regime in Israel, which treats Palestinians as second-class humans, the U.S. government goes on to treat us like second-class citizens in our own country.”
Meanwhile, Muslims and Palestinians have reported incidents of discrimination throughout the nation this week. In New York, for example, a group of men waving Israeli flags assaulted an 18-year-old Palestinian in Brooklyn. Numerous individuals at a rally looked directly into a camera as they exclaimed threats including “Kill all Palestinians, all of them!” and “Flatten them like a parking lot … once and for all.”
On Thursday, when asked about what her message is to Palestinians who fear for their own loved ones as Israel maintains a siege in Gaza, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called on “law-abiding Palestinians to reject Hamas,” without addressing the question of Palestinians’ own concerns.
While the FBI has activated resources to investigate Palestinians in the span of just a few days, its track record of successfully investigating crimes committed by Israelis against Palestinian American citizens has proved far less urgent, noted Jarrar of DAWN.
He pointed to the cases of Alex Odeh, an activist who was assassinated in California in 1985, and Shireen Abu Akleh, a journalist who was killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank last year. “When Palestinian Americans like Shireen Abu Akleh and Alex Odeh are murdered by Israel, the FBI does nothing about it,” Jarrar said. “But when we protest injustice by Israel, the FBI knocks on our doors.”
After the FBI announced an investigation into Abu Akleh’s killing, which multiple organizations reported was premeditated last year, the Israeli government announced that it would not cooperate with the investigation. Israel’s then-Defense Minister Benny Gantz told the press that the FBI’s inquiry represented “interference in Israel’s internal affairs” and that he had “made it clear to the American representatives that we stand behind the [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers, that we will not cooperate with any external investigation.”
Decades earlier, Odeh, who was the West Coast regional director at ADC, was murdered before speaking at Congregation B’nai Tzedek, a Reform synagogue in Santa Ana, California. As The Intercept previously reported, two prime suspects in Odeh’s killing escaped to Israel, where they continue to live public lives. The FBI, meanwhile, continues to list a $1 million reward for information leading to the successful arrest and conviction of Odeh’s murderers."
a87f6a71-3733-49ea-9ea8-5a60242f6487,Exclusive - Hung Cao: Biden Cost Virginia Thousands of Jobs with Failure on Domestic Production of Personal Protective Equipment,"Virginia Republican Senate candidate Hung Cao says former President Donald Trump’s project to domestically produce personal protection equipment (PPE), such as medical gloves, that the Biden administration has dropped the ball on, would have led to thousands of new jobs in southwest Virginia.
Cao joined Sirius XM’s Breitbart News Saturday, where host Matthew Boyle highlighted the Biden administration’s failures with the project, which originated amid a shortage of PPE during the coronavirus pandemic. Specifically, he zoned in on the rising number of imported nitrile gloves from China.
RELATED VIDEO — Giroir: Biden Must Demand China Stop “Hiding” Sequence of 100% Lethal COVID, It’s Admission of Guilt with COVID-19:
“What’s happened under President Biden is the percentage of these gloves that are imported from China has skyrocketed to nearly the majority of them,” Boyle noted. “And meanwhile, there are empty factories that are built thanks to President Trump, but they aren’t making anything because of President Biden and because of Democrats like Tim Kaine that are sitting there in southwest Virginia.”
On top of this, Sens J.D. Vance (R-OH) and other Republican senators sent a letter on February 29 to Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra expressing concerns about PPE supply chains and underscoring the Biden administration opted not to build on the “foundation established by Trump,” but to “start from scratch — and failed.”
Boyle asked Cao if he holds concerns about the supply chain and America’s dependence on China for gloves should there be another pandemic, asking, “Are you concerned about this? Are you concerned about the U.S. dependence on this, and what are we doing to get these things made in America again?”
“That’s a great question,” Cao responded. “So, two percent of nitrile gloves are made in the United States right now, and with the bill that President Trump introduced, like you said, in southwest Virginia, where the economy’s gone bad because they demonize coal — they’re looking for other ways to do it — this would have created 2,500 jobs in southwest Virginia. Six factories. Right now, over 70 percent of the nitrile gloves are made in China.”

Breitbart · Hung Cao – March 2, 2024
One shuttered plant in Wythe County underscored the bureaucratic failure in a contract with Blue Star. Construction for a rubber-production factory, which cost the federal government $123 million, was completed last spring, but the plant was shut down in the fall as the contractor was left without government-appropriated funds to create a factory to fashion the rubber into the nitrile gloves, the Washington Post reported:
Washington initially planned to build two factories with Blue Star, one to make the rubber and another to turn the material into medical gloves, which were in dangerously short supply in the early days of the pandemic. But by the time the rubber plant was erected, the worst of the pandemic and glove shortages had passed. Now, federal officials say, Blue Star’s contract is complete even though it still needs $60 million to hook up the rubber factory to utilities and $170 million to build an adjacent glove factory. The company will have to win a new contract or find private funding to move forward.
Blue Star shared exclusively with Breitbart News its compilation of government data showcasing that medical glove imports from China have tripled since 2019. In 2023, China “increased its share of imports of medical gloves to the United States to 44.15 percent” versus 14.2 percent in 2019, as Boyle previously reported. It is on track to account for 60 percent of medical gloves in the U.S. in 2024 at the current trajectory.
“This touches every American every day from the person who packs the meat in the stores to your food vendors to first responders like my wife, who’s an EMT, to everybody; even police officers have to wear it now… because they’re afraid of fentanyl touching and it gets absorbed into the skin,” Cao said. “We have to wear these things. We depend on them, and the Chinese quality is not the same as American quality. We live by a standard, and what if their standards are wrong? What if it was laced with something else? I’m just saying anything can happen when it’s not done in the United States, and we need to protect our country. We need to protect our people. And that starts with onshoring all these resources, especially personal protective equipment, PPE.”
Cao also noted that the Vance letter to Becerra followed a letter from Sens. Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Mark Warner (D-VA) to Beccera, “touting how great he did to increase the production, but what they did is they offshored it to China.”
“I mean, this is a travesty, and Tim Kaine is 100% complicit with this,” Cao charged.

Why it matters: Solid-state batteries have been the energy-storage holy grail for years, and if a company can commercialize the technology soon it would help bring electric vehicles to the masses.
Driving the news: A battery expert at Toyota said the company has been able to simplify the production process of materials for new solid-state batteries, the Financial Times reported.
Toyota said the development will enable it to manufacture an electric vehicle that can have a range of 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) and can charge in 10 minutes or less by 2027 at the earliest.
Solid-state batteries use a solid polymer for the electrolyte and a lithium metal for the anode part of the battery.
The big picture: Toyota has been slower than rivals to transition to all-electric vehicles, and a key battery advancement could help the company compete.
It also could be seen as a Hail Mary effort, in an attempt to remain relevant as companies like Tesla scale up EV production dramatically.
Reality check: Solid-state batteries have been under development at both big battery makers and startups for years, and new battery technologies take a long time to achieve mass production.
Sony commercialized the first lithium-ion battery in 1991 and it's taken close to three decades for those batteries to get low-cost enough to power today's electric vehicle market.
Ergo, don't be surprised if Toyota misses its new timeline for its solid-state batteries.
What's next: Meanwhile, automakers and battery manufacturers across the globe are investing billions of dollars into getting an edge in the race to electrify transportation."
988756a7-f5e0-4c31-a62b-6164ef682ad4,How Minnesota's weed legalization will play out on college campuses,"Minnesota college students hoping to take advantage of the state's new law legalizing marijuana will have to do it off campus.
Driving the news: Though recreational marijuana will be legal in Minnesota by the time the 2023 academic year begins, many local colleges are updating or establishing policies to ban its possession or use on campus property, Axios found.
Students who live in off-campus apartments can consume cannabis products, but state law still prohibits smoking and vaping marijuana in multifamily buildings.
Context: Under the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (DFSCA), colleges and universities that receive federal funding are required to establish policies that clearly prohibit ""the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of alcohol and illicit drugs.""
Leili Fatehi, a lawyer and policy expert who has led efforts for marijuana legalization in Minnesota, says many schools will likely play it ""better safe than sorry"" and ban weed entirely.
What they're doing: Macalester College and the University of Minnesota cited the DFSCA in their decision to continue to ban THC products. Hamline University and Minnesota State University, Mankato are still reviewing the state's law before announcing policies, they told Axios.
Between the lines: Federal laws don't necessarily have to come into play at all, as universities can on their own establish or update student codes of conduct to ban drug or alcohol use and possession on campus.
Plus: Smoking or vaping in school buildings was already illegal under the Minnesota Clean Indoor Air Act, and several colleges including the U and St. Catherine University have gone completely smoke-free.
Plus: A large number of students aren't 21 — the legal age to buy or consume cannabis — so the state legalization would not apply to them, a spokesperson for MSU-Mankato said.
Reality check: It's no secret that drinking and drug use still occur on campus, despite age and legal restrictions, and enforcement can vary widely among universities.
A University of Minnesota spokesperson said decisions to contact law enforcement are on a case-by-case basis until the law goes into effect.
The intrigue: Colleges in states where weed is already legal, like Colorado and Washington, saw an increase in applications following marijuana legalization, according to a 2022 study."

Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" has already become one of the most successful movies of 2023, smashing summer box-office records. It's also been dominating pop-culture conversation since it was released in July. Some argue it's a feminist masterpiece; others (including many right-wingers) have written it off as overly woke and anti-man.
Representation of minority groups in the cast appears to be a less polarizing topic. Gerwig and her crew seem to have gotten that right, for the most part: Barbies of all shapes, sizes, and ethnicities play prominent roles in Barbie Land, and they're portrayed by a diverse cast that includes actors from several underrepresented communities.
Except for the disabled community.
The 'Barbie' movie's disabled cast members don't have speaking roles
Issa Rae plays Barbie Land's Black, female president. Hari Nef, a trans actor, plays a Barbie who is a doctor. Alexandra Shipp and Scott Evans, who both identify as members of the LGBTQ community, have several memorable onscreen moments as a Barbie and a Ken, respectively. Though the dolls in Barbie Land are free of sexuality and sexual desire, and Nef isn't necessarily playing a trans Barbie, the casting of all three actors in prominent roles marks important representation for the LGBTQ community.
Issa Rae in ""Barbie."" Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures
And yes, there are some disabled Barbies seen in Barbie Land. There's a wheelchair-using Barbie who is visible enough in the big ""Dance the Night"" scene. Grace Harvey is credited on IMDb as ""Wheelchair Vet Barbie Doll,"" who appears briefly early on when narrator Helen Mirren explains the history of Barbie. There's also a Barbie with a bionic arm in one of the scenes in President Barbie's Pink House, too (the actor's name is Ashley Young).
The problem is, they don't say a word. And we never see them doing their jobs. They're only seen in blink-and-you-miss-it moments.
Poor disability representation destroys the myth that Barbie Land is a utopia. Rather, it's reminiscent of the real world, where people often forget to let wheelchair users speak, let alone join the workforce in a meaningful way.
Gerwig was obviously under pressure to represent entire communities in less than two hours, and that's unfair. In a summer blockbuster filled to the brim with stars, even prominent actors had smaller parts.
This doesn't change the fact that the disability community deserves more respect from all filmmakers.

Disability representation is facing an uphill climb within the 'inclusion crisis' in film
Disability representation in film was improving, according to a 2020 study by USC's Annenberg Inclusion Initiative. Nineteen out of the 100 highest-grossing films of that year featured leads or co-leads with disabilities, the study found. But the overall statistics are still grim. According to the study, only 2.3% of all speaking characters in the 100 top-grossing films of 2019 were disabled.
According to RespectAbility, 27.2% of the US population at the time had a disability. The fact that only 2.3% of the characters with speaking roles had a disability represents the largest difference in the ""inclusion crisis in film"" said Lauren Applebaum, the organization's vice president of communications in a press release about the study.
I don't begrudge Gerwig personally for her oversight, but it must be said — just because disabled Barbies exist in Barbie Land, doesn't mean representation of disabled people was adequate. It's not enough to trot these disabled Barbies out only to place them back in their boxes immediately after you feel you've done enough to check a community off your diversity list."

Scotland and Netherland both won five matches out of seven at the qualifier event but the Dutch finished with a better net run rate after Thursday's victory
A 10-team Cricket World Cup is ""a bit of a kick in the teeth"" for nations like Scotland, argues former captain Kyle Coetzer.
The Scots narrowly missed out on this year's tournament in India, finishing third at the qualifier.
Only two countries from 10 progressed from event in Zimbabwe, with Netherlands beating Scotland on Thursday to go through on net run rate.
""A 10-team World Cup is not enough,"" Coetzer told BBC Scotland.
""It's not only Scotland, but other countries have strengthened the case. Everyone has strengthened the case in terms of associate cricket.
""It is clear to see that the development is there, whether it is developing as fast as it should do is another story, but it is developing.
""They have all fought a battle to help grow the game and a 10-team World Cup seems a bit of a kick in the teeth for sides that have surpassed full members in the qualifier.""
Scotland beat West Indies, twice World Cup winners, in Zimbabwe, along with the host nation and Ireland, with that trio of Test-playing countries also failing to reach the finals.
The World Cup switched from 14 to 10 in 2019 and is to return to 14 again in 2027 and 2031.
""Even when it gets back to a 14-team World Cup people are going to be asking for 16 because the game has got to grow,"" said Coetzer, 39, who retired from playing in March.
After the pain of missing out on qualification, the former opening batter insists the Scotland squad ""should hold their heads high"".
And the Aberdonian, who is an assistant coach with women's side Northern Diamonds, believes the team will continue to make strides.
""It will get tougher because all the other teams are in similar situations, everyone is catching up, the field is getting a lot closer,"" he said.
""Oman maybe haven't achieved what they feel they could at this tournament, but they are a hugely dangerous side.
""Look at Nepal, the excitement about cricket that they have - and the skills - and how much they have developed.
""Every team is finding ways to improve but the ability to do it faster than others is the trick and I guess having good people around the team, creating opportunities to play more cricket, being really specific with what is required around white ball cricket, I have no doubt Scotland will continue to progress."""

ac6d579d-fc7e-4db0-97cb-ab889e8cbc61,National Zoo returning beloved pandas to China on Wednesday after 23 years in U.S.,"Pandas at National Zoo head back to China All pandas in U.S. zoos are heading back to China, threatening five decades of ""Panda Diplomacy"" 03:48
The Smithsonian National Zoo's beloved giant pandas began their trek back to China on Nov. 8 after 23 years in the U.S. The pandas, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, were on loan for a research and breeding program and in 2020 gave birth to a baby named Xiao Qi Ji, who is also heading to China.
Ahead of the pandas' farewell to the zoo, the Smithsonian said in a news release that forklifts will be used to move each of them into FedEx trucks. The trucks will transport them to Dulles International Airport, but they will not be visible as they are moved onto the ""FedEx Panda Express"" – a Boeing 777F aircraft with a custom decal.
Their estimated departure from the airport is slated for 1 p.m.

Mei Xiang and Tian Tian came to the zoo in 2000 as part of an agreement between the zoo and China Wildlife and Conservation Association and were supposed to stay for just 10 years, but the agreement was extended several times. The agreement was set to expire on Dec. 7, 2023.
The National Zoo first received pandas from China in 1972 in an effort to save the species by breeding them. The zoo has had panda couples ever since.
During her time in D.C., Mei Xiang has given birth to seven cubs – three who died before adulthood and three who have already been returned to China. Per the agreement, the baby pandas are returned by age 4.

After National Zoo pandas' official departure, only four giant pandas that were part of the program will be left in the U.S.: Lun Lun and Yang Yang, the giant pandas at the Atlanta Zoo, and their offspring Ya Lun and Xi Lun. This panda family is expected to head back to China in 2024.
San Diego also had pandas as part of the agreement, receiving its first two pandas in 1987. They were supposed to stay just 100 days, but like the deal with D.C., the zoo's agreement was extended several times and Bai Yun and Shi Shi stayed in the U.S. until 2019. They had six babies at the zoo.
The Memphis Zoo had a 20-year loan agreement with China that ended in 2023 with the return of Ya Ya in April, according to the Associated Press. One of their male pandas, Le Le, helped other pandas across the world conceive babies through artificial insemination, the zoo said. Le Le died in February ahead of the return to China.
Breeding programs have been successful for the once-endangered species. Pandas were upgraded to ""vulnerable"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 2017, according to the World Wildlife Fund. But only about 1,864 pandas remain in the wild, mostly in China's Sichuan Province."

Revolutionize Hiring by extending referral programs to include individuals outside the company, enabling recruiters to tap into the vast user networks for talent recommendations for optimal job-candidate matching. The effectiveness of crowdsourcing is visibly demonstrated across multiple sectors, including open-source software, ridesharing, residential rentals, private investing, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and collective ownership in real estate and private jets. Deconstructing traditional economic value chains and promoting shared value have introduced notable efficiencies in provisioning products and services across various industries. In a similar vein, a well-designed crowdsourcing referral program can be transformative in talent acquisition. Employing external referrals beyond standard practices accesses a varied talent pool, diverse skills, and cost-effective solutions.
“Referrals, an often overlooked yet potent tool, are being harnessed by Bondex, an advanced talent acquisition platform, to ignite more effective and efficient matchmaking,"" states Ignacio Palomera, CEO of Bondex.
Bountiful, a referral-as-a-service platform, harnesses the strength of social networks by leveraging personal and professional connections to attract high-caliber job candidates and form superior, diverse teams. ""The impact of network effects is significant in accelerating talent acquisition,"" remarked Scott Sinatra, CEO and Co-Founder of Bountiful. ""Despite being a prime source for exceptional hires, referrals are frequently intricate and underutilized.""
The hiring market landscape
The job market is radically evolving due to Artificial Intelligence (AI), data analytics, and cybersecurity. In 2023, tech layoffs increased by 50%, exceeding 240,000 as companies invested more in AI and cut jobs. Despite this, there's no surplus of tech candidates, continuing to make tech hiring tough. Job openings still surpass available talent, keeping tech unemployment low at about 2%. For 2024, foresee a dual trend in hiring: a high demand for top tech professionals combined with a cooling in the broader job market. These undercurrents will drive both job seekers and employers to actively seek optimal matches, opening new opportunities in professional talent platforms.
Recruiting pain points for hiring companies include scarcity of qualified candidates, competition for top talent, length of the hiring process, and candidate skills and experience verification. These dynamics are especially acute in tech, where demand for specific skills outstrips supply. Dependence on self-reported education and skills is inefficient and prone to inaccuracies and fraud. Verifying candidates' credentials, skills, and past work experiences is critical but time-consuming. Employers struggle with assessing resumes and interview performances for job fit, and the rise in AI and automated applications floods the process with excessive resumes, further complicating recruitment.
Job seekers similarly face many pain points, such as opaque hiring procedures, intense competition, frequent rejections, and lack of experience. To navigate these issues, strategies like building a strong professional network, developing tailored resumes and cover letters, and setting distinct career objectives can boost applicant profiles among recruiters and assist in securing the sought-after job.
Digital talent platforms grapple with the evolving demands of the recruitment market, encountering challenges such as low user engagement and obsolete resumes, resulting in mismatches between job openings and candidates.
LinkedIn, the world's largest professional networking site, connects professionals and provides an extensive job board for permanent, full-time, and temporary roles. LinkedIn, however, has a high ratio of dormant accounts with inactive users, as members primarily utilize it for job searches or as a repository for their resumes. Their engagement usually spikes when considering job changes. LinkedIn job listings often attract a deluge of outdated and mismatched resumes, complicating and slowing down the recruitment process.
The challenging job market is leading more people to opt for freelancing and part-time work, bypassing the rigorous interview processes of full-time jobs. Platforms such as Upwork, Toptal, Fiverr, Braintrust, and others serve as key global freelance marketplaces, linking skilled talent with hiring companies. These platforms employ advanced AI and Machine Learning (ML) technologies to enhance matching precision. They filter candidates by factors like years of experience, skills, and salary expectations, thereby increasing talent platforms' effectiveness and appeal. The global freelance platform market is projected to expand from $5.52 billion in 2022 to $6.46 billion in 2023 and further to $11.7 billion by 2027, with an estimated CAGR of around 16.01%.
Braintrust boasts a robust network featuring over 500K vetted talents and numerous Fortune 500 clients. Rigorous vetting ensures employer confidence in hiring skilled, pre-verified talents, setting Braintrust apart from other platforms. Furthermore, their referral program compensates participants with 2% in BTRST tokens from customer billings, effectively functioning as an external sales team. ""BTRST tokens are our secret sauce for incentives mechanism and governance system,"" says Adam Jackson, Braintrust's Founder. ""Additionally, our platform's ability to offer swift, adaptable, and cost-effective hiring solutions is immensely appealing.""

1d2afc09-16a5-4d8e-aadb-1e50d7bc475b,Robotaxi regulators say Tesla hasn't contacted them about plans,"SAN FRANCISCO — Two California agencies that regulate robotaxis said they haven’t heard from Tesla about its plans for the cars, even though Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced last week that he’ll reveal a new robotaxi product in August.
The California Department of Motor Vehicles and the California Public Utilities Commission, or CPUC, said in separate statements to NBC News that Tesla hadn’t applied for the two permits it would need to operate a driverless car service in the country’s most populous state.
The lack of permits — or any attempt to acquire them — raises questions about how quickly Tesla would be able to get a robotaxi service up and running.
“Tesla’s a long way away from getting that approval,” said Brad Templeton, a consultant in the autonomous vehicle industry.
Representatives for Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.
California, which has been ground zero for the rollout of robotaxis, requires aspiring robotaxi services to obtain at least two permits.
The DMV handles permits to deploy autonomous equipment on the road, and Tesla currently has the lowest-level permit, allowing it to test autonomous vehicles with human drivers present. Only three companies have the highest-level permit, which allows them to deploy autonomous vehicles without human drivers.
“Tesla has not applied for a deployment permit with the DMV,” the department said in a statement in response to questions.
If Tesla were to deploy robotaxis that are autonomous, it added, “the DMV will take steps to make certain that Tesla operates under the appropriate autonomous vehicle permits.”
The CPUC handles permits to operate robotaxis as businesses, including for tech startup Waymo’s services in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Tesla has no CPUC permit and hasn’t applied, the commission said.
“If Tesla wanted to provide a robotaxi service they’d need to follow the same rules as other such companies (i.e., DMV approval for driverless testing/deployment before seeking a CPUC permit). The CPUC has not been contacted for such a permit,” the commission said in a statement in response to questions.
Waymo, a spinoff of Google, needed eight months to get its initial CPUC permit to operate a robotaxi business that could charge fares, as opposed to offering free test rides only. It applied in December 2022 and won approval in August.
Templeton said it’s possible Tesla’s timeline for approval could be shorter than eight months — or longer.
“It could also be that they think Tesla is premature and they never approve it,” he said. Templeton is a former member of Google’s self-driving car team, which became Waymo, but he left a decade ago and said he no longer has ties to the company.
Tesla has approached the challenge of self-driving technology differently from Waymo, for example. Tesla has relied less on expensive hardware sensors such as LiDAR, and it has deployed driver assistance systems in stages nationwide while Waymo and General Motors subsidiary Cruise focused on mastering small geographic areas, such as parts of the Phoenix and San Francisco metro areas.
Tesla does not yet have publicly released technology for a car to drive without human supervision. Its “full self-driving” product requires a human driver to be present and ready to take over at any time.
Each state handles robotaxi regulation differently, and it’s possible that Tesla could seek to launch a service without California, although it would mean cutting out a major market. Tesla was the No. 2 seller of new cars and light trucks in the state last year, with 230,589 new registrations, behind only Toyota, according to a report from the California New Car Dealers Association.
Musk hinted at his plans in a brief post late Friday afternoon on X, writing: “Tesla Robotaxi unveil on 8/8.”
He gave no details about his plans, but the post boosted the morale of Tesla fans on social media who had watched the company get battered in the business media and on Wall Street. Three days earlier, Tesla shares fell after the company reported a drop in deliveries, but on Monday, the next trading day after Musk’s post, Tesla’s share price rose 4.9%, Reuters reported.
Tesla message boards have been rife with speculation about what Musk’s August announcement would be. It’s not even clear whether Musk plans to announce a vehicle, a service or something else.
Musk has talked about a robotaxi service for years. In 2019, he discussed plans to launch a robotaxi fleet using Tesla vehicles that people had leased and then returned. That strategy would have shifted the startup costs of building a fleet — in particular, the depreciation costs — to leaseholders, drivers and analysts noted at the time.
Musk has also talked about a robotaxi service with decentralized ownership, in which Tesla owners could rent out their cars for fares.
Tesla may need authorization from various states or localities to operate a nationwide robotaxi fleet.
In Arizona, Waymo and Cruise have permits from the state Transportation Department to operate as “transportation network companies.” The department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Tesla has applied or would need to apply.
Cruise, which also obtained California permits for a robotaxi service, halted operations nationwide last year after one of its cars in San Francisco failed to detect a pedestrian pinned underneath it and then dragged her for 20 feet. California officials also accused Cruise of failing to properly disclose details of the incident, and they revoked Cruise’s permits. Cruise said this week it was resuming testing with human drivers.
Amazon subsidiary Zoox has said it has authorization from Nevada to operate a robotaxi service, which hasn’t launched. Nevada has a “self-certification” process for robotaxi operations, and the Nevada DMV says it will issue a “certificate of compliance” to those eligible.
The Nevada DMV has not received paperwork from Tesla to begin the certification process, said Eli Rohl, a department spokesperson, but he said the process doesn’t need to take long.
“If Tesla was interested in getting certified or permitted in Nevada, they could likely do so in short order,” he said in an email.
Tesla already has a rocky relationship with California regulators. In 2022, the California DMV accused it of engaging in deceptive practices around the marketing of its driver assistance systems, including using the product name “Full Self-Driving.” An administrative hearing in that matter is scheduled for September."

It might seem obvious that you’d want to work with a broker who has high standards when you’re selling your home or commercial property. Certainly, there are various requirements that salespeople must have to operate in the market. However, it can be important to check for signs that the broker will act ethically throughout the sales process.
Keep in mind that it’s essential to find someone who will take a long-term view of the relationship. A credible broker will act with your best interests over their own. They’ll be a fiduciary and make sure to do right by you, even if it’s to their detriment. As I mentioned in my previous article, it’s really important to have a professional put themselves in your shoes and be client centric.
Follow these guidelines to learn more about a broker’s standards and evaluate if they align with yours.
Check for Real Estate Credentials
It’s common for brokers to have state licenses, and many also obtain higher levels of certification. In commercial real estate, this could include distinctions such as CCIM, which stands for Certified Commercial Investment Member and indicates they are a recognized expert in the real estate industry. They might also have obtained additional coursework from their local real estate board. They may have higher learning, such as continuing education, professional studies, or a master’s degree.
Review the Commissions Landscape
If a broker is representing your property for sale, they’ll be receiving offers which could come directly to them or be from another broker. If the bid comes straight to the broker, they could make a full commission on the deal; however, if the offer is from another broker, they might have to split the fee. This means that a direct offer could yield double the commission for a broker compared to a split commission with a co-broker involved.
You’ll want to watch and listen to make sure your broker handles these situations wisely. If they are pushing to work with a direct buyer, it could potentially be a sign that they are hoping to get a full commission and avoid splitting a fee 50/50 with another broker. Observe conversations to see what statements they are making and which questions they are asking. You’ll want to be working with someone who is looking to get the best offer for your property, regardless of how the commission will be impacted in the end.
Check the Broker’s Interest in Purchasing
Some brokers sell properties, and also invest in real estate. I do this myself; however, it’s essential to follow certain guidelines to avoid a conflict of interest. If you’re working with a sales professional who offers to represent you to sell your home or building, and then shares that they would prefer to buy your property themselves, it could be a red flag. That’s because there is a possibility that they are not looking to get the highest price for your asset. In fact, they could be aiming to swoop in and buy the property for a lower amount.
When I act as an investor, I always buy properties represented by another broker. That way, I know the owner is working with an advisory team to get the best price. The broker has the chance to run a professional marketing campaign and look at offers from various buyers interested in the property.
As you carry out initial conversations with brokers, pay attention to their educational background and how they respond to your questions. During the sales process, be aware of the commissions landscape and look at the potential buyers that are approaching the property. If the broker asks to purchase your home or commercial space, it may be a sign to consider working with another sales professional. In the end, you’ll want to partner with a broker who has high standards and ethics, and who will act in a professional manner throughout the sales process."

Now Catalonia and the Balearic Islands have chosen Top Manta, a Barcelona-based cooperative representing the mostly migrant, undocumented sellers, as inspiration for its entry to the Venice Biennale on architecture, which opened last weekend.

Top Manta is named after the vendors (manteros) who spread their wares on a blanket (manta). “It was established in 2015 after a period of intense police repression to support people who, because of the law, can’t find a place to live or open a bank account and are forced to live in the street,” says Lamine Sarr, a manteros spokesperson who, like many Top Manta members, is from Senegal.
The theme for this year’s biennale is The Laboratory of the Future, with Africa as its focus. The Ramon Llull Institute, a Catalan cultural organisation that organises the region’s participation in the biennale, ran a contest, and the architectural practice Leve Productora won with an entry called Following the Fish.
Leve’s Daniel Cid says: “We asked, ‘Where do we have a laboratory of the future in Barcelona?’ We thought: Top Manta. Let’s make a project with them that will make us rethink architecture from the perspective of an African immigrant.”
Sarr adds: “The fish symbolises that the people in Top Manta aren’t here because they come from poor countries but because their countries have been exploited and colonised for centuries. Fishing by large boats has made it impossible for local fishermen to survive. We decided to choose the fish because it’s symbolic of not only the exploitation of the sea but of all natural resources.”

The stand in Venice is in two parts. The first, a mantero market, depicts the journey of the African diaspora, the hardships of the migration process, the border policies and discriminatory laws of Europe. The second, a reparation workshop, comes from a collaborative process between Leve and architecture students from 26 countries working on new housing models, based on repurposing empty shops and buildings.
Cid says the idea is to bring African values of sustainability and communality into the conversation about how we live.
We have also been able to demonstrate that this way of living has a much smaller environmental impact Daniel Cid, architect
It is a learning process, says his colleague Eva Serrats, to see a community created out of necessity. “The proposal, from an architectural point of view, is knowing how to live. For example, they have a lot more experience of cooperative living than we do, of communal spaces and communal eating – which doesn’t have to imply poverty – and of using one space to do many things, which also brings life to the street.”
Cid adds: “We have also been able to demonstrate that this way of living has a much smaller environmental impact.”
In Spain, there is, as yet, no US-style “green card” amnesty offered to undocumented migrants. Last week, Sarr presented the Spanish government with a petition signed by more than 600,000 people calling for the regularisation of the country’s estimated half a million stateless citizens.
Last month, the Italian government, led by the far-right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, declared a state of emergency over the arrival of migrants crossing the Mediterranean. According to government figures, 31,292 migrants arrived into Europe that way between January and April, four times the number in 2022.
Some will question the ethics of giving manteros such a prominent platform at the biennale, given that, before Top Manta started producing its own T-shirts and trainers, it sold cheap copies of branded shoes and bags, effectively in breach of copyright.

This misses the point, says Cid, that they have been forced into marginal activity to survive. “There’s a food crisis in Senegal that is caused by western interests. Europe exploits them, Europe creates hunger, and when they arrive in Europe they face racist laws that make it impossible for them to work.
“The question isn’t what they have to do to survive, but why we allow such conditions to exist.”
Under Spanish law, to obtain legal residency, non-EU immigrants must live in the country for three years, prove they have had a fixed address for at least a year, show they are learning the language and have a work contract for a minimum of one year. Such conditions are often impossible to meet.
Serrats says Top Manta will present Catalonia in a new light in Venice. “We want to present Catalonia and the Balearics to the world through different eyes, not through western eyes, and through people whose voice isn’t normally heard, because we believe we can learn a lot from this voice,” she says.
“Rather than be curators or narrators, we want them to tell their story.”"

The rhinoceros calf, born on Christmas Eve, will be named through a Sweet 16 bracket, the zoo said. The calf's mom is named Kiazi and her dad is named Mumbles.
Zoo Atlanta's Rhino Care team will submit nine names for the ""Rhino Naming Madness"" bracket. The zoo is allowing people to submit suggestions for the other seven bracket options from Thursday through Sunday. Brackets and the first round of four rounds of voting will launch on March 20, with the winning name to be announced on April 11.
The calf, a southern white rhinoceros, is the first to be born at Zoo Atlanta. She's Kiazi's third child, according to the zoo. Kiazi previously gave birth at another organization before coming to Zoo Atlanta.
Kiazi and her newborn calf at Atlanta Zoo Atlanta Zoo
The calf is 12-year-old Mumbles' first child, the zoo said. He met Kiazi early last year.
Kiazi's pregnancy was first detected in the spring, the zoo said. White rhino pregnancies last for a whopping 16 and 18 months. Newborns weigh between 100 and 150 pounds, and Kazi's calf currently weighs between 350 and 400 pounds, a zoo spokesperson said Thursday.
The zoo earlier had not been able to weigh the calf after her birth, a zoo official told CBS News. Kiazi was being very protective, so the zoo made sure the mother and her calf had as much privacy as possible.
""Mama continues to be VERY protective,"" the zoo wrote in a Feb. 16 Facebook post.
The pair will continue bonding behind the scenes before joining the main rhino habitat, the zoo said. Mumbles will meet his child sometime this summer.
Southern white rhinos are classified as ""near threatened"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. They are the only one of the five rhino species that are not considered endangered, according to the World Wildlife Foundation.
White rhinos can live between 40 and 50 years, according to the zoo. They stand up to 6 feet tall at the shoulder and can weigh up to 6,000 pounds."

The proposed merger, which also involves the DP World Tour, is facing two separate Senate investigations, both launched this week, and a new threat by the chairman of the Senate finance committee, who said he would introduce legislation to revoke Saudi’s state-backed fund’s tax exempt status.
“The PGA Tour’s involvement with the PIF [Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund] raises significant questions about whether organisations that tie themselves to an authoritarian regime that has continually undermined the rule of law should continue to enjoy tax-exempt status in the United States,” Ron Wyden, the Democratic chairman of the finance committee and one of the toughest critics of Saudi Arabia on Capitol Hill, wrote in a letter to the PGA’s management.
Senator Ron Wyden is demanding answers from the PGA Tour relating to its proposed merger with the Saudi-funded LIV Golf. Photograph: Shutterstock
In the four-page letter to PGA Tour commissioner, Jay Monahan, and chairman, Ed Herlihy, Wyden demanded to be provided detailed information about issues ranging from the players’ free speech rights, to the structure of the deal and compensation of managers, to whether the PIF’s potential ownership of US real estate posed a threat to national security.
Washington has a long history of disrupting proposed mergers and acquisition that are politically unpalatable, and the PGA’s shock announcement that alongside the DP World Tour, formerly the European Tour, it had agreed to a merger with the Saudi’s LIV Tour – following a year of bitter litigation between the parties and which in effect would mean Saudi Arabia taking control of top-level golf – comes at a time when Saudi relations with Washington are at a low.
One long-time attorney who works on foreign transaction said the proposed merger comes as Joe Biden’s administration is growing increasingly frustrated by Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman’s warm relations with China. The kingdom has few vocal allies in Washington.
There are several hurdles that experts said could stand in the way of a deal. The most obvious one would be a decision by the US Department of Justice to block the deal on antitrust grounds. The Biden administration could also – in theory, and under pressure from Congress – decide to launch a national security review of the proposed transaction.
While Congress has fewer concrete tools to block a deal, measures like Wyden’s proposed bill to strip Saudi’s sovereign wealth fund of tax exempt status could bite the kingdom.
The proposed merger will not only face opposition from senior Democrats like Wyden and Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy of Connecticut, but also Republicans who have expressed discomfort with the transaction, as well as a vocal and important lobby of family members of victims of the 9/11 terror attacks on the US, who said in a recent statement that they had been “betrayed” by the PGA’s decision to reverse course and agree to a deal.
Khalid Aljabri, a Saudi expert and frequent commentator on US-Saudi relations, said the PGA-LIV merger exemplified Bin Salman’s blueprint of using infinite resources to “bully” his way to getting a seat at the table.
In announcing the merger last week, Monahan accepted “people are going to call me a hypocrite” given his previously hostile stance to LIV but he insisted the move was the correct one for golf, a view shared by Keith Pelley, the DP World Tour’s chief executive. “It’s an exciting time for global golf and the men’s professional game,” said Pelley. “I am just thrilled with the announcement and what it means going forward.”"
3ed669ee-e54a-412e-a569-08215d34fd53,"Amid criticism over his war on gangs, El Salvador's President Bukele turns to sports","SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — El Salvador President Nayib Bukele stood before tens of thousands of roaring sports fans with a message: I am not a dictator.
“They say we live in a dictatorship,” Bukele said, but “ask bus passengers, people eating in restaurants, waiters. Ask whomever you want. Here in El Salvador, you can go anywhere and it’s totally safe. … Ask them what they think of El Salvador, what they think of our government, what they think of our supposed dictatorship.”
In the opening ceremonies of the 2023 Central American and Caribbean Games, the remark was met with a burst of applause and, in some swathes of the remodeled stadium, chants of “Reelection!”
The games have offered Bukele – the bitcoin-pushing 41-year-old leader who has sparked a sort of populist fervor in his Central American nation and beyond – an opportunity to showcase a safer El Salvador in the largest international event here since his government entered an all-out war against gangs. But the competition also comes as Bukele is accused of systematic human rights violations for that same crackdown and as his government takes steps that eat away at the country’s democracy.
Observers worry events including the games – drawing athletes from 35 countries across the region – will allow Bukele to save face internationally and show voters he has global support as he seeks reelection despite a constitutional ban on terms of more than five years.
Often referred to as “sportswashing” – the use of sports to divert attention from controversy and improve reputations amid wrongdoing – the tactic has been wielded by autocratic governments across the world for decades. The accusation was most recently slung at Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for his investment in golf, the World Cup and other international sporting events.
“These are events that give oxygen to the government to distract attention from the huge problems we have and show a face of modernity to the world,” said Eduardo Escobar, executive director of Acción Ciudadana, an independent political watchdog group in El Salvador.
A little more than a year ago, Bukele announced the nation would enter a state of emergency, a measure suspending constitutional rights in an effort to confront surging gang violence.
Since, the government has detained 70,000 people – about one in every hundred Salvadorans – imprisoning them with little access to due process. The government has labeled them gang members, though as few as 30% have clear gang ties, according to human rights group Cristosal’s estimates.
The moves have been met with an avalanche of international criticisms, including by the Biden administration.
Simultaneously, crime in El Salvador has dipped to historic lows, and Bukele’s approval has soared, holding strong at 90% in June, according to a CID Gallup poll. Bukeleism has gained traction from Colombia to Guatemala and the Dominican Republic as politicians seek to mimic him and cash in on his popularity.
The dip in violence opened the door for his government to host events including the games and the upcoming Miss Universe pageant. The opening ceremonies of the games flaunted the country’s newfound status, with dances lead by an AI-robot voice and a performance by American DJ Marshmello.
For Sel Ramirez, a Salvadoran who has spent decades jumping between his country and the United States after fleeing civil war in the ′90s, it was like seeing an entirely new country. He’s among many here embracing Bukele fervor - he occasionally even dresses up as the president and walks around the city center.
After Bukele’s opening speech, Ramirez stood outside the stadium with a crowd awaiting for the leader’s exit - a scene similar to those at Taylor Swift concerts. Yet steps away sit heavily armed soldiers and black armored cars with machine guns on tops.
“I wonder if he’ll give me his autograph,” mused Ramirez, his eyes glued to the door from which the president would later depart.
As the crowd waited, Defense Minister René Merino walked out to cheers. “El Salvador is a country in peace,” he told The Associated Press. “We are open to the world.” When asked by the AP about those imprisoned, he responded “no” and walked away.
Ahead of the games, Bukele’s government slashed 70% of publicly elected positions, whittling down the number of congressional and local government seats. Bukele said the cuts would improve efficiency and crack down on corruption, the same reasons given for gutting El Salvador’s courts in 2021.
Legal experts and other Salvadoran politicians say these are just the latest steps in a conquest to solidify power ahead of February’s election.
“This is typical for autocratic governments,” said René Hernández Valiente, former head of the country’s constitutional court. “They are erasing the philosophies of our constitution.”
The move will boost Bukele’s control of congress by 22%, according to estimates by watchdog group Acción Ciudadana. Other candidates told AP it left them scrambling by reshuffling the rules months before the vote.
Bukele’s party, Nuevas Ideas, made the announcement that he’d seek reelection days into the games, on Twitter. It was an anticipated yet controversial move. In the tweet, at 1 a.m. local time, the party declared itself “invincible.”
In the following days, Bukele’s Twitter account – his preferred means of communication, and a place where he once described himself as the world’s “coolest dictator” – posted videos of soccer matches, photos of tanned surfers, and clips of his opening speech. He posted little about his reelection campaign.
The rise of social media has made it harder for leaders to present large sporting events as apolitical, but sportswashing usually works because athletic events are both highly visible and seen as a distraction from daily problems and politics, said Alan McDougall, a sports historian at the University of Guelph in Canada.
“Successfully hosting an international event can give a regime confidence to kind of to act with impunity. Sport is a bit of a shortcut way to win yourself, not even popularity, just an acceptance,” said McDougall, who dates the use of athletics as a political tool to the 1930s, when a Mussolini-run Italy hosted the World Cup and the Olympics were held in Nazi Germany.
And while many in El Salvador celebrate a new reality marked by roaring stadiums and fireworks, those suffering amid Bukele’s crackdown feel forgotten by the rest of their country.
Among them is activist and union leader Ingrid Escobar, 40. When she left home one day in late June with her two kids to run errands, she saw men waiting outside in a gray truck criminologists later identified as one used by government security forces. The sight has become familiar over the past three months. So, too, has the fear.
Unions, human rights groups, opposition politicians, researchers and journalists have said that as the election cycle heats up, Bukele’s government has intensified intimidation tactics. One union of government workers says at least 15 organizers have been detained, accused of public disorder and gang ties. About half are still imprisoned, according to the union.
“The fear we have is that we’ll be the next ones he arrests despite never having broken the law,” Escobar said. “And for no reason other than we are denouncing the government, of being the voice of people who are too scared to speak out.”
Bukele has said he’ll open a new prison “for the corrupt,” a label he often uses for opponents. Escobar worries that may mean her. She said she’s received death threats on social media. She now uses different vehicles, takes different routes to work. She fears for her kids and tries to shield them.
That morning, she took a photo of the truck’s license plate and sent it to a colleague. Her children asked why, and she fibbed: “Oh, because I like the car.”
Miles away, gymnasts flipped before judges, swimmers dove from starting blocks, and runners leaped hurdles in the same stadium where Bukele made his speech.
Few knew about the radical changes the leader was making around them around them or the fears of everyday people like Escobar.
“I’ve heard a little bit,” said Francisco Acuña, a 23-year-old gymnast from Costa Rica. “But I don’t really think about politics.”

2f20ed55-bf28-46b7-873b-8cbed555cb0f,"Beatles' Paul McCartney, John Lennon's sons' song excites fans, but dads' shadow may be 'inescapable': expert","Paul McCartney's son James McCartney and John Lennon's son Sean Ono Lennon came together for a surprise new single.
More than 60 years ago, the Beatles legends formed one of the most successful songwriting partnerships of all time, famously known as Lennon-McCartney. James, 46, recently revealed he had teamed up with Sean, 48, for a second-generation collaboration of Lennon-McCartney as he debuted a new song, ""Primrose Hill,"" that the pair co-wrote.
""‘Primrose Hill’ is here! Today I am so very excited to share my latest song co-written by my good friend @sean_ono_lennon . With the release of this song it feels like we’re really getting the ball rolling and I am so excited to continue to share music with you,"" James captioned a photo of himself with Sean.
""Enjoy the song,"" James added, reminding his followers to enter his ""Primrose Hill"" music video contest. On April 2, James announced the contest on his official website. He invited fans to submit videos of couples capturing the ""essence of love and romance"" that might be included in the official music video for ""Primrose Hill."" Submissions for the contest have closed.
JOHN LENNON NEARLY WROTE WITH PAUL MCCARTNEY AGAIN AFTER BEATLES BREAKUP, EX SAYS: ‘WOULD HAVE HAPPENED'
James also teased the release of ""Primrose Hill"" in an Instagram post April 2, writing, ""I had a vision as a child in Scotland, on what was a lovely summer’s day. Letting go, I saw my true love and saviour in my mind’s eye. ‘Primrose Hill’ is about getting the ball rolling with me & finding that person.""
Paul celebrated the song's release with a Facebook post promoting ""Primrose Hill.""
""My son James has a new song out called 'Primrose Hill' - check it out! And lots of love to Sean Ono Lennon who co-wrote the song,"" he wrote, adding a red heart emoji.

Paul shares James with his ex-wife, Mary McCartney, while John, who was assassinated in 1980, shared Sean with his wife Yoko Ono.
This is far from the first musical venture for James and Sean, though ""Primrose Hill"" marks the first known official collaboration for the duo. James and Sean followed in their fathers' footsteps and embarked on careers in the industry, as have the sons of the other two Beatles members, Ringo Starr and George Harrison.
Lennon's oldest son, Julian Lennon, 61; Starr's sons Jason Starkey, 56, and Zak Starkey, 45; and Harrison's son Dhani Harrison, 45, also became musicians.
Over the years, the icons' sons have addressed the challenges of living up to their fathers' legacies, though they have acknowledged they have been afforded many opportunities because of their parents' success and connections.
Zak candidly addressed the difficulty of forging his own path in the Beatles' wake in a comment on a video that a Paul McCartney fan account shared on Instagram. In the clip, which was set to ""Primrose Hill,"" James plays the piano and smiles.
""New music from Beatle sons! A McCartney/Lennon collaboration from James McCartney and Sean Lennon!"" the account wrote on the video.

""Sad ya can’t just walk your own road,"" one social media user commented on the post.
""the Beatles are an impenitable (sic) wall u cannot go thru over or under - I was 25 when I came to terms with that - up until then I was so f------ frustrated by it, "" Zak replied.
In a 2013 interview with the Daily Mail, James told the outlet, ""It’s hard to live up to the Beatles.""
PAUL MCCARTNEY REVEALS HE 'DREAMS' ABOUT THE LATE JOHN LENNON: 'THEY'RE ALWAYS GOOD'
""When Wings toured, they got slated,"" James added. ""Even Dad found it hard living up to the Beatles. I started out playing under an alias because I wanted to start quietly.
""I had to serve my time as a musician and wait until I had a good body of songs and for a time when both myself and my music were ready. I don’t want to sit around. I want to earn my own living.""
In an interview with Fox News Digital, brand expert Doug Eldridge of Achilles PR noted it was ""inevitable"" the Beatles' scions would struggle to escape the Fab Four's shadow.
""The Beatles were/are arguably the most iconic band of the last century. It wasn't just their music, it was the timing and branding around their image, as much as their IP,"" Eldridge said.
""From matching suits to ‘long hair' to the bearded, drug-induced, anti-war chapters at the end. Any surfer will tell you: To become a great surfer, you must conquer a great wave; without that perfect wave, you're merely a good surfer who never had a chance to shine.
""By way of analogy, the Beatles paddled out, waited for the monster wave and rode it to immortality. Life is, and always will be, about timing. Getting out of their parents' shadow is as tough as escaping the earth's gravitational pull; culturally speaking, it's arguably even tougher. There's no shortage of iconic stars whose progeny followed in their steps, but despite their own success, they fell short of reaching their parents' level of acclaim.""
Eldridge noted Bob Dylan's son Jakob Dylan of The Wallflowers, Hank Williams' son Hank Williams Jr. and grandson Hank III and Led Zeppelin drummer Jon Bonham's son Jason Bonham were among the progeny who followed in their fathers' footsteps.
""And the list goes on,"" he added. ""That said, there are also a short list of unicorns who managed to carve out their own image — not another musical face on Mount Rushmore, but rather, their own face on the mountainside of a new generation.""

Eldridge cited Billy Ray Cyrus' daughter Miley Cyrus, Julio Iglesias' son Enrique Iglesias and Nat King Cole's daughter Natalie Cole as examples of unicorns.
""Admittedly, it's a short list, and those names are few and far between. When your parent is a giant, they cast a long, long shadow; sometimes it can be inescapable,"" he said.
Eldridge also weighed in on whether it is possible for the children of famous musicians to forge their own paths.
""When someone scores a 100 on a test, the best you can do is equal their score with another 100; there's no way to conceivably surpass what was previously done,"" he said.
""Sadly, even if you manage to replicate that level of greatness, it will likely be marginalized as being the ‘son of’ status, as if some level of nepotism is either to credit or blame for their (lack of) commensurate achievement,"" Eldrige added.
""That said, when it comes to finding your own path, perhaps the best approach still comes from Robert Frost: ‘I took the one less traveled ... and that has made all the difference.’""
After ""Primrose Hill"" was released, the single was generally met with praise from critics. One reviewer noted that the song shows ""promise,"" but added, ""It does little to suggest that it will be the moment the son outshines the father.""

However, many Beatles' fans reacted enthusiastically to James and Sean's unexpected collaboration in the comments of his Instagram post.
""Beautiful. You can certainly hear the influence of Paul and John, but it’s also your own sound. Love it,"" one social media user wrote.
""Never thought I (sic) see another Lennon and McCartney original,"" another fan commented.
""The first lennon-mccartney in more than 50 years…"" a follower chimed in.
""So happy for this to happen,"" one social media user gushed, along with a string of emojis.
""I LOVE THE ""MINIMALISTIC"" APPROACH!!"" another fan wrote. ""I'm so glad they didn't overreach or try to make something Epic (which sometimes people expect)... They did a simple, beautiful Melody with outstanding poetry. JOB WELL DONE!!!""
""Beautiful! Lennon-McCartney goes on! Your dads are proud!"" a follower raved.
One fan urged James to ""make a band With Zack, Dhani and Sean,"" which was an idea the musician had previously floated.
""I don't think it's something that Zak wants to do,"" James told the BBC of forming a band with fellow Beatles' sons in 2012. ""Maybe Jason would want to do it. I'd be up for it. Sean seemed to be into it, Dhani seemed to be into it. I'd be happy to do it.""

When asked if he thought the second-generation band ""could happen,"" James said, ""Yeah, hopefully, naturally. I don't know, you'd have to wait and see. The will of God, nature's support, I guess. So yeah, maybe.""
However, James later clarified his remarks in a Facebook post after they went viral.
""Hi Everyone...well, looks like quite some attention being given to my BBC interview! Honestly, I was just thinking out loud about playing with Beatles family friends, nothing more. My band's going to be on tour in the UK and US for most of this year, and the shows are going great! I'm so grateful…Lots of love to you all…!"""

62dafd88-4289-46c9-abd4-7b6880cf6ff3,"Vargas, Ruiz, Alu homer as Nationals take series opener from Athletics, 8-2","WASHINGTON (AP) — Ildemaro Vargas homered and drove in four runs, Keibert Ruiz went deep at home for the first time since May and the Washington Nationals defeated the Oakland Athletics 8-2 on Friday night.
Jake Alu added his first major league homer for Washington, which has won six of nine overall and 10 of 12 at home.
Oakland has lost seven of 10 and are a major league-worst 33-83. The A’s are on pace to finish 46-116. There were chants of “sell the team” in the top of the fifth inning, a message directed at Oakland owner John Fisher, who plans to move the franchise to Las Vegas.
Four Nationals relievers combined for six shutout innings after starter Joan Adon left with an undisclosed injury. Adon halted his warmups before the fourth.
Cory Abbott (1-1) replaced Adon and earned his first big league win by allowing one hit in 1 1/3 innings.
Ruiz’s fifth-inning homer off Paul Blackburn was his 13th this season but only his third at home and his first at Nationals Park since May 19. He lofted an elevated 91 mph sinker to right off Blackburn (2-3), who allowed four runs in 5 2/3 innings.
Vargas padded the lead with a three-run drive off Sam Long in the seventh, and Alu homered off Long on the first pitch of the eighth.
Adon, who allowed Jordan Diaz’s two-run single in the first, appeared to have discomfort in a leg while warming up before the fourth. Manager Dave Martinez and athletic trainer Paul Lessard were summoned and quickly decided Adon’s outing was over.
Washington tied it in the second on back-to-back RBI singles by Vargas and Stone Garrett, and went ahead on Alu’s sacrifice fly in the fourth.
Oakland’s Lawrence Butler was recalled from Triple-A Las Vegas and went 0 for 4 in his major league debut.
TRAINER’S ROOM
Athletics: 2B/OF Tony Kemp was placed on the paternity list and … C Carlos Pérez (thumb) caught five innings for Las Vegas on Thursday. … RHP Mason Miller (forearm tightness) will throw a live batting practice session Saturday in Arizona. … 1B Ryan Noda (broken jaw) will taking batting practice Saturday.
Nationals: RHP Hunter Harvey (elbow) threw 21 pitches in a simulated game Friday. “He’s really close,” Martinez said. … RHP Tanner Rainey (Tommy John surgery) had a 23-pitch simulated game. … RHP Carl Edwards Jr. (shoulder) also threw a simulated game, and Martinez said he could begin a rehabilitation assignment soon if things continue to go well. … RHP Thaddeus Ward (shoulder) threw a bullpen session.

Triumph for women 1915 Getty Images
“I’m not sure if I should go for this new role,” said Stacey, an extremely talented advisee of mine. She and I met earlier this week to talk about her goals for 2024 and some tradeoffs she was considering.
Stacey is a highly accomplished sales leader at a large global company. She learned about a General Manager opening in her company’s new high-flying division. Everyone is encouraging her to apply. Mentors. Peers. Former bosses. She has real reasons to be cautious; she recently welcomed twins, and there are parts of the role that she loathes.
“You can have it all, just not at the same time.” She offered a little whimsically.
Here’s the thing.
The statement is total hogwash.
I view our ‘CANNOT HAVE IT ALL’ mantra as an anesthetic of sorts, meant to divert our attention away from addressing the very real societal barriers that stand in the way of true equity & opportunity.
I realize my views are impolitic but stay with me as I offer a new lens on the definition and vocabulary surrounding our often-used mantra.
Definition
Whose ALL is it?
How we define ALL really matters.
Here’s a secret from the science of human development. If ALL for you is defined by the expectations of others, it will never be achieved. Never. Conversely, if ALL for you is aligned with what holds value and meaning to you, anything is possible. No boundaries.
Is your ALL made up of things you care about or an amalgam of things you picked up from others along the way?
By focusing on the definition of ALL, HAVING or NOT HAVING becomes an assessment of our performance against the expectations you carry.
We rarely stop to think about the expectations we carry. To do so, we need to reexamine the taken-for-granted assumptions we may have consciously - and unconsciously – scooped up along the way.
Stacy had always clung to one important belief; to become a general manager by the time she was forty.
“What’s the matter with me?” She asked aloud. Here she was within spitting distance of that goal, and she was hesitant.
“Where did ‘GM by 40’ came from?” I asked. She did not have a quick answer. She recalled tossing it around during a few late-night chat sessions with her college buddies. She had never stopped to question its efficacy. Until now.
Some expectations have outlived their useful life and deserve to be released. Others may need to be resized. Still others need to be dreamed up and welcomed into the mix.
What might happen if you approached HAVING IT ALL as an invitation to recenter the expectations you carry?
Vocabulary
The other side of rethinking our favorite mantra is about the vocabulary itself and its influence. The net of it is simple; vocabulary matters.
My research over the past decade with individuals navigating career transitions leads me to understand vocabulary more completely. We believe that which we frequently say. With this in mind, the statement “I CANNOT HAVE IT ALL” overtime serves as an artificial barrier – one that causes downshifting instead of demanding real change. Our widespread societal use of this phrase, I CANNOT HAVE IT ALL, fortifies systemic inequality.
Without our mantra’s presumptive exclusion, we would be slamming our fists on the table insisting on the removal of discriminatory barriers. There are layers upon layers of these barriers throughout society, including unpaid parental leave, unpaid FMLA leave, lack of subsidized child & elder care, lack kindergarten for all, unequal pay, lack of federal social security accrual for unpaid work in the home, and more.
Barriers, real and artificial, shape our perception of what is possible. getty
Let’s stop pretending that ALL is about what we can and cannot have. It is a diversion tactic used to take our eye off establishing policies and programs that are required to invalidate historical exclusionary practices.
Stacey offered wistfully, “Corporate has taken so much out of so many of us.” Yes, she knew the trade-offs thanks to her familiarity with speeding down the highway of today’s workplace with one hand tied behind her back.
Isn’t it time to have an honest national conversation about the needs of workers - regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation, education, socioeconomic status, or other qualifiers – and set in motion actions to address them.
The one truth in all of this is that we can never have it all as long as we ALL means operating within an outdated single gender normative model defined by someone else.
Lose the mantra and remember: ALL can be whatever YOU decide – and that is the hardest hurdle of all."

The expert shoppers at CBS Essentials (that's us!) have put together some shopping tips to help you get the best deals available during Amazon Prime Day 2023.
What is Amazon Prime Day?
Amazon Prime Day is an annual two-day sales event created by Amazon. The e-commerce giant puts tons of top-selling products on sale exclusively for Amazon Prime subscribers. Prime Day is an excellent opportunity for shoppers to score brand-name tech, kitchen appliances, furniture, clothing, toys, beauty products, and more for Black Friday-like prices.
When is Prime Day 2023?
Amazon has not yet announced the dates for Amazon Prime Day 2023. It typically occurs in late June or mid-July.
Amazon Prime Day 2022 took place from Tuesday, July 12 to Wednesday, July 13. As such, some people are predicting that this year's event will begin on Tuesday, July 11 and end on Wednesday, July 12. Though in 2021, Amazon chose June 21-22 as the Prime Day sale dates, so it's worth noting that there can be quite a bit of variation in the sale dates.

2. Shop early and check back regularly
The best deals on Amazon Prime Day often sell out quickly, so you'll want to start early if you're hoping to score a doorbuster deal on a big-name brand. However, it's important to remember that new deals will be unveiled regularly, so keep checking back periodically for new lightning deals. Amazon also typically unleashes a new set of deals on day two of the sale, so even if you shop the first day of the sale, it's worth circling back for more discounts.
3. Filter the deals
The main Amazon deals page can get a bit overwhelming on Amazon Prime Day with so many major discounts. Plus, as mentioned above, there will be deals from just about every product on Amazon available to shop. We recommend narrowing your deals search by category to get a better view of the deals that fit your needs. You can use the menu bar along the left side of the Amazon deals page to filter by category. You can also filter by star rating to make sure that you're only seeing deals on well-rated products and don't accidentally impulse-buy a poor-quality item.
CBS Essentials will also be publishing category-specific deals lists all throughout Amazon Prime Day 2023 to help you cut through the noise and find the top deals in each category on products with at least 4 star ratings.

Will Samsung move some of its Galaxy AI features behind a paywall in two years? The Galaxy S24 Ultra product page suggests that this is the case.
Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, Galaxy Unpacked 2024, London, United Kingdom EWAN SPENCE
Samsung’s note on the Galaxy AI features can be found in the footnotes on the Galaxy S24 Ultra page on the US site: ""Galaxy AI features will be provided for free until the end of 2025 on supported Samsung Galaxy devices. Different terms may apply for AI features provided by third parties.”
Subscription services for software are not unknown—Adobe has several subscriptions across its portfolio, and consumers will be aware they can purchase extra storage from cloud services to increase storage. If Galaxy AI services became a paid-for feature, how much would consumers be willing to pay to play? Maximising revenue and maximising the number of users would need to be balanced by Samsung if the company decided to go down this road.
Samsung’s Galaxy AI works both on-device and in the cloud, and it’s unclear whether a distinction will be drawn between the two services. Several Galaxy AI features require an internet connection and a Samsung Account. As the use of AI tools becomes more prevalent, there could be a significant cost of offering heavy-duty AI services in the cloud.
Can Samsung make Galaxy AI attractive enough that consumers will feel a burning need to buy into the service?
Update: Sunday January 21: While Galaxy AI has made an impressive debut and will form a key part of the Galaxy S24 story, there will only be a small window of exclusivity afforded to the new handsets. The South Korean company has confirmed its intentions to have Galaxy AI cascade down to older handsets.
Speaking to Android Authority, a spokesperson stated, ""Many of the Galaxy AI features introduced on Galaxy S24 will also be supported on previous models including Galaxy S23 series, Galaxy S23 FE, Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Flip 5, and Galaxy Tab S9 series within 1H 2024. Please stay tuned for more details.""
Galaxy AI is seen as a standalone product available across the Galaxy range, which does diminish the impact of the Galaxy S24 family. They may be the first AI-powered smartphones from Samsung, yet the attractiveness of upgrading from an older handset has been weakened… depending on which AI features make it over and at what cost.
Samsung Galaxy Unpacked invitation (early 2024). Samsung Pressroom
AI is an extensive term for several software tools; it's hard to call which will be successful, which will be niche, and which will fail in the next six months, let alone over two years. Samsung may not have made a final decision on the role of Galaxy AI as part of its 2026 plans, which would mean a qualifier about the potential for degradation of service, as we see here, is important.
Unfortunately, it leaves a question mark hanging over the long-term plans of the Galaxy S24 family and the Galaxy AI software.
Samsung has been approached for comment; this article will be updated with any response."

391746df-3c90-4f29-8739-bd2117b885c9,Beatrix Potter Accused of Stealing 'Peter Rabbit' Stories from 'Enslaved Africans Working on American Plantations',"The late British author Beatrix Potter is being accused of stealing the stories for her Peter Rabbit books from slaves in America, with a woke literature professor saying Potter is guilty of the “appropriation” of black culture.
In a recent essay, Emily Zobel Marshall, who teaches postcolonial literature at Leeds Beckett university in England, claimed Beatrix Potter ripped off the oral “Br’er Rabbit” folk tales told by slaves working on southern plantations. In addition, she accuses Potter of deliberately hiding the “sources” of her literary inspiration.
“Her tales owe a debt to the Brer Rabbit stories told by enslaved Africans working on American plantations that needs to be fully acknowledged,” Marshall wrote in her essay, which was published this month in The Conversation.
Zobel Marshall alleges Potter’s early contact with the “Brer Rabbit” tales was a result of her family’s roots in the cotton industry, which she describes as “exploitative.” She also alleges Potter learned of “Brer Rabbit” tales through the books of American journalist and folklorist Joel Chandler Harris, who created the “Uncle Remus” character.
She claims Potter tried to “steer readers away from her sources” and that her actions were “problematic,” adding that the Peter Rabbit books are really about the “resistance and survival tactics of the plantation life of enslaved people in the Americas.”
Zobel Marshall conclude, “Potter’s actions in shielding the reading public from her sources have fed into a damaging and reoccurring appropriation of Black cultural forms that continues today.”

DSM city manager Scott Sanders announced his resignation in a staff memo yesterday, effective in six months. Why it matters: He is the primary advisor to City Council, responsible for managing day-to-day business of the largest municipality in Iowa.
Catch up fast: Sanders was appointed to his current position by the council in 2014 following the retirement of Rick Clark.
He managed during some of DSM's most challenging times in recent decades — including floods in 2018 and the pandemic.
Sanders was consistently awarded pay increases by the council following annual reviews — from $195K when he started to just over $310,000 in the current fiscal year.
Yes, but: Some advocates of police reforms voiced frustration with his work and called for his resignation in 2021.
The intrigue: Sanders' memo did not detail his specific future plans but said he's looking forward to a new chapter in life that ""fully prioritizes my family and my health.""
His work will not waiver in the remaining months that he's on the job, he wrote. He did not respond to Axios' request for comment.
What they're saying: Mayor Connie Boesen called Tuesday ""a bittersweet day"" and wished Sanders the best, she said in a statement."

Carlo Ancelotti hailed his Real Madrid team after winning El Clasico 3-2 against bitter rivals FC Barcelona at the Bernabeu on Sunday night.
A 91st-minute Jude Bellingham strike was enough to seal the victory and an 11-point lead at the summit, which led Ancelotti to conclude that the La Liga title is ""much closer"" to Real Madrid TV.
""I'm very proud, because they were two very demanding games,"" the Italian remarked, in reference to this match and a Champions League quarterfinal second leg against Manchester City his side also won midweek.
""We handled them very well and we are very happy. Now we have to prepare for the last part of the season, but we are well positioned, with a lot of desire and enthusiasm and a fantastic atmosphere at the Bernabeu. I think all together we can achieve something positive this season.""
Ancelotti's opposite number Xavi Hernandez slammed the match official for his performance, plus La Liga's lack of match football which him and his captain Marc-Andre ter Stegen called an ""embarrassment"".
Pushed to remark on this, Ancelotti said: ""I don't want to comment on what Xavi thinks. Everyone is free [to think what they want]. It was a difficult and well-played, high-level match. I don't think the goal was a goal, because there's no clear image [of it]. And the penalty [on Lucas Vazquez] I think is clear.""
Vinicius Jr. seemed to have a bit of row with the manager when brought off, and Ancelotti shed a light on their heated discussion in the dugout.
""He didn't like the change. He wanted to continue, but it was time to bring in fresh legs,"" Ancelotti said.
As for the hero of the evening Bellingham, who became the first player to score in his first two Clasicos for Real Madrid since Ruud Van Nistelrooy in 2007, Ancelotti noted that the Englishman ""hadn't scored for a long time and scored a goal that is very important"".
""It's been a while since he's scored, but he played a great game.""
On upcoming matches, Ancelotti vowed that is team is ""going to face them seriously, because it's the best way to prepare for the Champions League"" where Bayern Munich await in the last four.
""This week has been spectacular, unforgettable. It couldn't have been done better. As usual, we haven't given up."""

The big picture: There can also be a psychological perk to clearing clutter, says Lauren Greenwood, founder of home organization brand YouCopia.
""It's a place that's within your control, in a world that sometimes feels out of control,"" she tells Axios.
Yes, but: If you find yourself struggling to get started, Greenwood recommends taking a vacation day to tackle nagging projects.
Happiness researcher Gretchen Rubin calls it a ""loose ends day."" You'll feel much better after you purge your closet or collect those empty Amazon boxes.
What they're saying: ""Might, could, maybe and someday"" are the swear words of organizing, Klug says.
They're typically uttered when people are justifying or rationalizing keeping things they know they don't need, Klug tells us.
Here are some of Klug's spring cleaning tricks.
📦 First, sweep the home for cardboard. ""Yes — even if it's 'a good box' — just recycle it!""
👀 Take a second sweep for items ""you know instantly you're ready to donate."" (Something you haven't used in years is a safe bet.)
Toss it in a bag and drive to the donation or recycling spot that day.
😌 Let go of guilt. People often hold onto items because they feel guilty about the money they spent, but that dough isn't coming back.
What's next: 2024 is all about concealing the chaos, Greenwood says."

But they weren’t expecting their kids to get booed.
Kelly Stafford, wife of current Rams QB and former Lions QB Matthew Stafford, says she was ready for a good ribbing from the fans in the city where she and her husband began their NFL life. However, she did not take kindly to having her kids booed, which she says happened during the Rams 24-23 loss to the Lions.
“It’s sports,” Kelly said on Instagram Monday. “The city wants to win. Everything is fair game … except the fans who booed my children.”Other than that, I loved the atmosphere and the booing just gave my husband more fire.”
Not that the boo birds soured Kelly Stafford’s mood too badly. She still wished the Lions well going forward.
“The more you love, the more you hate. I consider it all love going both ways,” she said.
“I hope the Lions bring home a Lombardi to that city because that feeling is like no other.”
The victory snapped a 32-year playoff win drought for the Lions. The Miami Dolphins now hold the dubious record for the longest period of time without a playoff win."

Brand recognition is one of the top goals for marketers and communicators, regardless of your industry. Ensuring your company is top of mind to your target audience and your competitors is a game changer in helping you increase profitability and boost sales. Best Business Awards has determined that award-winning small businesses can see a 63% increase in operating income, and large companies can see a 48% increase. These stats alone make it clear that putting your best foot forward and trying to win awards can make a significant difference to your bottom line.
While robust marketing strategies, stellar reviews and testimonials are always great goals, there’s another way to help you stand out: winning awards and stacking accolades. Not only do awards help you put your money where your mouth is and prove that you’re making a difference, but they also offer one-of-a-kind opportunities to reach new audiences and tout your success backed by someone other than yourself.
If you don’t have a plan to apply for (and win) awards, here are some reasons why you should start today.
1. Gain Free Exposure
That’s right: winning awards equals free exposure, reach and publicity. After all, you’re being featured on their site as part of their award program, and you didn’t even have to pay for it. Any publication that hosts awards will naturally put forth its resources to market the applications and the winners. By winning an award, you are an extension of their marketing efforts, giving you exposure to their audiences. As a bonus, you can (and should) use this opportunity to share their content with your audience.
2. Build Credibility In Your Industry
Earning a place on an industry list helps you build credibility and stand out. The best way to accomplish this is to apply for awards that matter in your industry, and if you win, you will have succeeded in establishing your brand as the expert and stand out. Credibility is everything, and having a solid reputation backed by prestigious accolades is a great way to encourage prospective employees, clients and partners to take your brand seriously.
3. Strengthen Employee Morale And Attract Talent
Who doesn’t want to be part of an award-winning team? Employees who are proud of where they work may feel more inclined to stay loyal and work harder to make a difference. Outside recognition through awards is an excellent way for team members to not only feel like they are part of a company that is making a difference, but it is also a tremendous opportunity to encourage employees to share these successes.
Furthermore, awards can help you attract talent to your business. An award-winning company is an attractive place to be and may be just what you need to beat out your competitors when recruiting and retaining the top talent in your industry.
4. Help Define New Goals Based On Criteria
Goal setting is fundamental to every company’s success, and you likely already have a plan to set and meet annual goals. One benefit of awards that many don’t consider is that they have specific criteria to help you identify new areas to focus on. If there is an award that you would love to win but haven’t yet checked all the boxes to be the top contender, consider adding those criteria to your goals and giving your team something to work toward.
If You Haven’t Already, Put A Plan In Place Today
Applying for (and winning) awards doesn’t happen overnight. To stand out from the applicant pool, you must grind and prove that you deserve the recognition. The best way to get started is to identify at least five to 10 awards you want to aim for each year and then plan your strategy.
Everyone on your team has to buy into the plan and do their part for your best chance to win. However, marketing and communications teams drive the momentum. Together they can identify awards that you’re ready for now, find new awards to go for in the future, collaborate on application messaging and determine areas for improvement for your team so you have the best chance possible.

As communicators, we have a responsibility to elevate important stories. And as the CEO of a PR agency with a mission to tell stories that change the world, I believe this to be true even when organizations can’t afford a retainer to get the attention they deserve. Today’s workforce is hungry to make the world a better place, and as leaders, we have an obligation to support our team members’ personal and professional growth. One of the most effective ways to do both? Conscious Capitalism.
Through a pro bono program, you can champion causes your team cares about, enhance cross-company teamwork and inspire your team to be agents of change for the greater good.
In 2017, our agency launched its Conscious Capitalism program and has since worked with eight organizations (and counting!) to bring awareness to their missions. Each year, after opening applications to organizations across the U.S., our team selects one brand to receive pro bono PR services for a period of six months. Throughout the relationships, we tell their stories with holistic PR campaigns, including media outreach, social media management and influencer relations. Since the program’s inception, we’ve increased brand awareness and helped organizations reach key audiences. This year, our team was so energized to give back that we actually selected two organizations changing the world: a nonprofit that provides adoption assistance for children in vulnerable circumstances, and a nonprofit empowering students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to take ownership of their education.
In addition to supporting these worthy causes, our pro bono work has been incredibly fulfilling and rewarding for our organization. Here are just a few of the many benefits of implementing a Conscious Capitalism program.
Improved Retention And Recruitment
It’s well established that employees, particularly millennials and Gen Zers, want to feel a sense of purpose in their work, which is especially true in the wake of the pandemic. People want to work for organizations doing good and making a difference beyond the confines of the office.
That’s why our firm supports organizations that align with our team’s values, including those involved with climate change, youth services, children’s health and diversity programs. We select our Conscious Capitalism clients through an agencywide vote to ensure the organizations we partner with are ones the team feels passionately about.
Better Work-Life Balance
Programs that champion a healthier work-life balance have been proven to improve employee mental health and reduce turnover. By allowing your team to incorporate their personal values into their professional roles, they’ll likely feel more supported at work.
Alignment Between Work And Values
The values that shape your culture and business strategy should be backed by real action. Living those values shows integrity, authenticity and purpose. Saying you aim to do good is useless—what matters is how you actually do it.
We tell stories that matter and bring attention to the people, organizations and movements changing the world. We make this happen through thoughtful client selection, both for our Conscious Capitalism program and our accounts in general.
One of our previous pro bono clients provides access to venture capital for founders who are historically left out of these opportunities—namely women, people of color and other underrepresented groups. That’s the kind of story we want to shed light on, and because of our team’s genuine passion for the cause, they went into the media campaign with excitement and a drive to get results.
Equitable Access
Not every organization has a budget for PR, but that doesn’t mean they’re not deserving of media attention. For organizations that can’t afford a typical PR retainer, pro bono work is a smart, effective way to bring attention to their important causes.
An Opportunity To Stretch
While it can feel risky to take on a client in an unfamiliar industry, a Conscious Capitalism program gives your team members the opportunity to explore new markets and skills.
Most recently, our team partnered with an inclusive brewery and eatery that primarily employs individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Our campaign focused on restaurant influencer relations, which allowed the team to demonstrate their expertise in a growing market and build strong relationships with local influencers.
Conclusion
Conscious Capitalism programs should be treated like any other client account. This includes hosting a formal application process, drafting a contract, staffing the account and setting a specific time frame for the work to be done.
For our agency, the organizations we partner with don’t necessarily have to be a 501(c)3, but they must display these three traits: kick-ass culture, innovative work and continuous curiosity about making the world a better place.
Offering a Conscious Capitalism program or pro bono services is a win for everyone involved. It’s a powerful way to make a difference in your community and the world while supporting your team members to achieve their personal and professional goals.

7c16188e-728f-479d-8fb6-ae58f89c0141,Amanda Gorman denounces book bans: ‘It encroaches on our freedom’,"Amanda Gorman is speaking out against book bans, which caused the poem she recited at President Biden’s inauguration to be restricted at a Florida school, highlighting that it takes just a single complaint from a parent to “render that book inaccessible for everyone.”
“What I think is important to really absorb is there were thousands of books that were banned last year — over 2,500,” the 25-year-old poet said in a Wednesday interview on “CBS Mornings.”
“According to The Washington Post, the majority of those filed complaints were by 11 people,” Gorman said. “What that underscores for me is with how the structure works around schools and libraries with laws that have been passed: All it takes is one person or one quickly written complaint to render that book inaccessible for everyone else in that community.”
Gorman said last month that her poem, “The Hill We Climb,” which she famously performed at Biden’s 2021 inauguration, was restricted by a school in Florida’s Miami-Dade County.
“I’m fine with some parents not liking my poetry — that’s completely in their right,” Gorman told “CBS Mornings” co-hosts Gayle King, Vladimir Duthiers, Nate Burleson and Tony Dokoupil.
“But when we get to the situation where that one’s person dislike of my work leads to everyone else not having access to that, that is a huge issue I think because it encroaches on our freedom to really absorb, and love, and enjoy literature from where we are,” she said.
Gorman said she was shocked and saddened when she first learned of the Florida school limiting access to “The Hill We Climb” following a complaint.
“I couldn’t understand a reason for rendering this piece as inappropriate for elementary school students,” she said.
“When I wrote ‘The Hill We Climb,’ it was so important for me that young people would see themselves represented in a significant moment in our democratic history,” Gorman said, “and that the reality of that and that moment would be erased for young people who deserve to see themselves at a place, station like that — that was just really disappointing.”
Gorman noted research that showed the majority of book bans involve “characters of color or talk about race in some way” along with figures “that are of the LGBTQ community or touch upon those themes.”
“I have to think about what messaging that sends to young readers. It’s as if you’re saying, ‘You are inappropriate if you’re African American. You are inappropriate if you are gay. You are inappropriate if you are an immigrant.’”
“There’s this huge argument that it’s about protecting and sheltering our children from themes that are just too advanced from them,” Gorman continued. “But when you look at the majority of the books, that have actually been banned, it’s more about creating a bookshelf that doesn’t represent the diverse facets of America.”"

The nominations in 27 categories honoring the best in film and television are being announced by Cedric ""The Entertainer"" and Wilmer Valderrama beginning at 8 a.m. ET (5 a.m. PT). CBS News will livestream the presentation in the video player above. Nominations in 10 of the categories will also be broadcast live on ""CBS Mornings"" beginning at 8:30 a.m. ET (5:30 a.m. PT).
The 2024 Golden Globe Awards ceremony takes place Sunday, Jan. 7, from 8-11 p.m. ET.
The three-hour Golden Globes Awards show will be broadcast live on CBS as part of a new deal between the Golden Globes and the network. The ceremony will also be available to stream on Paramount+ and the CBS app. Paramount Global is the parent company of CBS.
The Golden Globes come to CBS after its longstanding relationship with NBC ended, and as the award show works to rebuild its credibility under new leadership following a widely publicized scandal and boycotts over allegations of racism and ethical lapses within the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which organized the Globes and voted for years to determine its nominees and winners.
The HFPA was disbanded and the Golden Globes were sold. Dick Clark Productions is now the owner and producer of the Golden Globe Awards.
In another change this year, the upcoming Golden Globes will mark the debut of two new categories: cinematic and box office achievement in motion pictures and best stand-up comedian on television.
The current eligibility period for consideration runs from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, meaning films and series released within that timeframe qualify.

c6f2b482-dc0c-4a06-b21a-e460517c5715,Letting in the light in a Finnish artist’s home,"Ten years ago, when Laura Annala was house-hunting in her hometown of Lapua, southwest Finland, there was one property that kept resurfacing. “It was a detached, yellow-brick bungalow built in the 1980s,” Annala recalls. “It had low ceilings so it wasn’t very bright inside and the rooms were either painted brown or covered in flowery wallpaper. It was really uninspiring.” For two months, she scrolled past the listing until one day her father decided to get on his bicycle and take a closer look.
He found the house was surrounded by a mature garden, thick with flowers and trees. The location was also ideal – it was opposite the local school and Annala and her husband, Jussi, were hoping soon to start a family. It was also “really cheap”, which meant they would have enough money left over to renovate the tired interiors. At the time, Annala, a hair stylist, was starting her own business. She had spent the previous decade living in Helsinki, Tampere and the Netherlands, where she had met Jussi. Now, she was hoping to open her own salon in Lapua. A budget-friendly, three-bedroom bungalow started to make sense.

“We signed the contract and two days later Jussi got seconded for three months 800 miles away in the north of Finland,” Annala says. Luckily, her father – who she describes as “an all-over handyman” – helped with the renovation. They dismantled a wall of cabinets that separated the kitchen from the living room, peeled off reams of wallpaper and replaced the bathroom tiles. Laminate floors were laid throughout. The walls and ceilings were painted either white or black.
Initially, the clean, monochrome scheme suited them. The couple went on to have a boy, Frans, and Annala continued to make a success of her new salon. Then, at the age of 32, when Frans was just a toddler, Annala was diagnosed with brain cancer. Her surgery and subsequent treatment left her with brain damage and chronic migraines.

“I couldn’t do hairdressing any more,” she explains. “I had to give up my career, my salon – everything. Of course it’s been heavy,” she says. “But I’m not too sad, because I started to paint.”
Drawing was something Annala had always done, but she didn’t have the confidence to pursue art as a career. “I just didn’t have the courage to try,” she reflects. Gradually, as Annala recovered from surgery and learned to live with her condition, she rediscovered her “long-lost calling” and found it to be “the best therapy”. Her moving, multi-coloured canvases began to fill their monochrome home.
‘Vibrant dreamscape’: Annala’s artwork in the living room. Photograph: Krista Keltanen/Living Inside
Soon, Annala’s sister asked her to design a small range of fabrics for the family’s textile company. Annala’s Colour Me Happy collection launched last year and includes blankets, curtains, cushions and fabrics in clashing, acidic colours from tangerine and turquoise to sky blue and lipstick pink. These, too, found their way into Annala’s bungalow. “I realised that my art and my textiles are both made of strong colours, but at home the black wall surfaces started to haunt me,” she says. “About a year ago, I decided to paint everything again. Now it makes much more sense.”
In the living room, the main wall went from black to powder blue. A vintage bookcase by the Finnish company, Lundia, rests against it. “Growing up, we had a similar piece in my parents’ house, so it feels like we’ve always had it.” The couple’s existing sofa was recovered in one of Annala’s own geometric fabrics and paired with a matching armchair. Where there is white wall space, Annala has hung one of her most recent works – a vibrant dreamscape of tumbling fruit, flowers and mythical beasts.

Many of the smaller pieces of furniture and accessories have come from Annala’s grandmother, “an artist and really stylish lady” who now lives in a care home. The ornate coffee table and kitchen chandelier were both hers, as was the gilt mirror in the main bedroom. “The inspiration for our bedroom was the actor Salma Hayek,” says Annala. “I wanted it to be hot and spicy and warm!” On the bed is one of her own designs – a quilted blanket that blares: “Life is lemonade.”
In the kitchen, Annala has replaced the wooden countertop with a bottle-green surface made from recycled plastics. “It has completely transformed the look of the kitchen,” says Annala. The splashback was also replaced with blingy tiles. The rest of the kitchen is original 1980s, albeit with a lick of black paint.

Annala now has a large studio in the centre of Lapua, but she has also created space for her practice at home. This corner of the house is warmed by a brick fireplace complete with Iron Maiden poster – a treasured gift from a friend in the Netherlands. The walls have been hung with paint-splattered wallpaper to hide any of the mess she might be making.
The hallway is home to two of Annala’s most precious pieces: a red and pink canvas painted at the time of her illness, and a work that depicts three jellyfish-like creatures. “It’s one of my first works,” she explains. “I sold it to a friend years ago, but when the opportunity arose for me to buy it back, I didn’t hesitate. I feel that the three figures represent our family.”

In its new guise, Annala’s joyful, art-filled home is a magnet for Frans’s friends, who pile in after school to stare at the walls. “They come over and say, ‘Wow! Your mum is really an artist!’ For Frans, now seven, it’s normal. He has only ever known me as a painter. But for me, I can’t really believe that I’m at this point. I’m still amazed.”

Breakfast sandwiches are big in D.C., and Axios' Ryan Kellett set out to find the best.
Why it matters: Who doesn't want to know about the summer's BEST breakfast sandwich?!
How it happened: Kellett, our VP of Audience and full-time foodie, spent a month eating through 10 of the area's most raved-about breakfast sando spots — recs courtesy of D.C. Reddit, Eater, and the Washington DC Foodies Facebook group.
Yes, but: ""Clearly there are so many more, including Baker's Daughter and Heat Da Spot,"" says Kellett.
The criteria: He didn't get too scientific. ""Simplicity and execution are key to a great breakfast sandwich.""
The contenders: So much eggy, cheesy, meaty breakfast goodness (you can check 'em out on our IG).
The winner: Hog Haven's swoon-worthy muffin sandwich with Irish cheddar and homemade sage sausage and eggs from their Virginia farm.
Their stall tours local farmers' markets — but get there early to avoid a line.
Runners up: Pearls Bagels (""A perfect egg to meat to bread ratio that's hard to do with bigger bagels."") and I Egg You (""No one else is doing milk bread so this one definitely stands out."")
Bonus round: If a hot dog is a sandwich, is a breakfast taco a sandwich? We'll make a dubious exception for Kellett's beloved ""512 taco"" from La Tejana with smoked brisket, egg, and queso."

THE LAST WORD
""Now, again, these two IRS investigators, they risked everything to come forward. Their claims about Hunter's alleged crimes were just proven true by a federal indictment and their new claims about Joe Biden's involvement in the Biden family business. Well, guess what? They're backed up with pictures, eyewitness testimony. They are backed up by suspicious activity reports, allegations from credible government source detailed in that FBI 1023 form , along with phone records and texts and emails and even a handwritten note. Well, on the other side, you have Joe Biden, who wants you to just simply trust him. Now, Joe has previously lied about, let's see, his past employment, his grades in law school, his trips on an Amtrak, the death of his own son, his actions after 9/11, his role in the civil rights movement, his nonexistent arrest in South Africa, his house getting destroyed by a fire, that wasn't true, his totally secure southern border, and the number of even grandchildren he has in his own family.""

Nick Cannon, who's fathered 12 children with six different women, had a vision that he would have many children.
Cannon described the incident while talking to podcaster Laura Berman, a sex and relationship therapist and podcast host, for an episode of ""The Language of Love with Dr. Laura Berman."" The episode aired on Wednesday.
Berman spoke to Cannon about visions he's had, and asked if God told him to have ""all those babies."" Cannon responded that he's had one moment when he communed with a spirit.
""It's almost like when you have these manifestations or even these visions, if that's what we want to call them, it's like, 'Oh, that all makes sense now,'"" Cannon told Berman.
""You get them in pieces, or they're fragmented,"" he said of visions he'd had about fatherhood, explaining that the visions never came through like a ""Father Abraham conversation."" According to the Bible, God promised to make Father Abraham the ""father of a multitude of nations.""
""I've never heard that clarity, but I heard that like, 'Yo, you're gonna be a father of many. There's gonna be your great influence, your lineage, your offspring are gonna do great things,'"" Cannon said.
""I had the vision that my name will be great as, like, the Rockefeller name,"" Cannon added.
Cannon also told Berman that some of the women he's had children with are monogamous with him, while others just want to co-parent. Cannon did not specify which women were monogamous, and which were not.
Cannon has previously said he is non-monogamous. But he added that his preference is for the mothers of his children to wait until their kids are a little older to pursue monogamous relationships with other people.
""I would hope it would happen a little bit later, once you've come into your own of what our parenting infrastructure looks like,"" Cannon said on the podcast.
Cannon also said he would be a little ""concerned"" if the mothers of his children were out sowing their ""wild oats"" and being ""out in these streets.""
But Cannon added during the podcast that he does not enjoy being called ""community dick"" and being mocked for having so many children.
Cannon has children with Mariah Carey, Abby De La Rosa, Alyssa Scott, Brittany Bell, Bre Tiesi, and Lanisha Cole.
And he might not be done yet: In February, he said he would let God decide when he should stop having kids.
Representatives for Cannon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider sent outside regular business hours."
621968c4-159f-480a-be44-45008e91f5bf,Sudden layoffs close after school program in San Francisco's Tenderloin,"SAN FRANCISCO - Looming deficits in the billions for the city of San Francisco are impacting services across the city and for some residents who need them the most.
One Tenderloin program for school aged children just closed, following heavy layoffs.
Parents are now scrambling to find childcare on limited budgets.
""We hand off kids between parents right now. It's hard when we don't know how long it's gonna be so we don't really know it's gonna happen,"" said Phung.
Dan Phung picks up food as part of a free program for Tenderloin families. His two children walk to the Tenderloin Afterschool Program everyday, and have a safe place until he finishes work.
But right now, there is no help.
""We're trying to find some programs but a lot of those are already filled up and those we have to pay for as well, so there aren't a lot of choices out there,"" said Phung.
The non-profit Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation, which relies on funding from the city, recently laid off 8 of 12 after school program employees.
They closed the doors, as confused parents say they were given no notice.
""You can see families are trying to figure out what to do, and so are we,"" said TAS staff member Rebecca Carrillo Steinrueck.
As parents scramble, so does Steinrueck, who's been working with kids for nearly 20 years.
She still has a job, but knows she can find another one somewhere else if more layoffs are on the way. It's the families she's worried about.
""Now, all of a sudden to say that's not here is almost unbelievable,"" said Carillo Steinrueck.
""I don't want it to close because it helped me a lot with my homework. It's really fun and the teachers are really nice,"" said 11 year old Sofia, who attends TASP everyday.
Nonprofits that receive funding from the city are facing major budget cuts.
Debbie Lerman is the director of the San Francisco Human Services Network.
""When the economy gets rough, we do not want to see health and human service programs cut because their needs goes up,"" said Lerman.
The Mayor's office is projecting a $780 million two year deficit and a whopping 1.3 billion deficit for the 2027-2028 fiscal year.
""Nonprofits are starting to hold back on their spending because we don't know what's going to happen, but we do know there will be cuts,"" said Lerman.
The Tenderloin after school program also relies on volunteers and additional community fundraising efforts.
Ranjan Dey's restaurant New Delhi, just around the corner, has been supporting the program for decades.
He often visits the children to inspire them of the possibilities if they never give up.
""This is a huge help to the community. My call to action is to let everybody know we need to protect the foundation of the house where we live,"" said Dey.
""This community shows up for its youth and that's not what we're doing right now,"" said Carrillo Steinrueck.
Some 70 children have been showing up to the afterschool program this fall.
Dan Phung isn't sure what's next, but knows for certain, what his young daughter is now missing.
""She said the thing that I'm missing is how fun and creative the staff are. They're not here just doing their job, they're actually helping the community in a really big way,"" said Phung.
It's a sobering reminder of sudden shortages in the Tenderloin, for so many children and their parents.
The controller's office says in the last fiscal year, the city gave $1.4 billion to more than 600 nonprofits."
1bf6d399-a2fc-47e8-a7bd-cc2282eb9c80,'Anatomy of a Fall' wins Cannes' Film Festival top Palme d'Or prize,"Associated Press
Justine Triet’s “Anatomy of a Fall” won the Palme d’Or at the 76th Cannes Film Festival in a ceremony Saturday that handed the festival’s prestigious top prize to a twisty French Alps courtroom drama.
“Anatomy of a Fall,” which stars Sandra Hüller as a writer trying to prove her innocence in her husband’s death, is only the third film directed by a woman to win the Palme d’Or. One of the two previous winners, Julia Ducournau, was on this year’s jury.
Cannes’ Grand Prix, its second prize, went to Jonathan Glazer’s “The Zone of Interest,” a chilling Martin Amis adaptation about a German family living next door to Auschwitz.
The awards were decided by a jury presided over by two-time Palme winner Ruben Östlund, the Swedish director who won the prize last year for “The Triangle of Sadness.” The ceremony preceded the festival’s closing night film, the Pixar animation “Elemental.”
The jury prize when to Finnish director Aki Kaurismäki’s “Fallen Leaves,” a deadpan love story about a romance that blooms in a loveless workaday world where dispatches from the war in Ukraine regularly play on the radio.
Best actor went to veteran Japanese star Koji Yakusho, who plays a reflective, middle-aged Tokyo man who cleans toilets in Wim Wenders’ “Perfect Days.” Wenders’ film is a gentle, quotidian character study.
The Turkish actor Merve Dizdar took best actress for the Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s “About Dry Grasses.” Ceylan’s expansive tale is set in snowy eastern Anatolia about a teacher, Samet (Deniz Celiloğlu), accused of misconduct by a young female student. Dizdar plays as a friend both attracted and repelled by Samet.

“The character I portray in the film is someone who is fighting for her life and she’s overcome a lot of difficulties. Under normal circumstances, I would have had to work hard on this character,” said Dizdar.
“I understand what it’s like to be a woman in this area of the country,” she continued. “I would like to dedicate this prize to all the women who are fighting to exist and overcome difficulties in this world and to retrain hope.”
Vietnamese-French director Tràn Anh Hùng took best director for “Pot-au-Feu,” a lush, foodie love story starring Juliette Binoche and Benoît Magimel and set in a 19th century French gourmet château.
Best screenplay was won by Yuji Sakamoto for “Monster.” Sakamoto penned Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda’s nuanced drama, with shifting perspectives, about two boys struggling for acceptance in their school at home. “Monster” also won the Queer Palm, an honor bestowed by journalists for the festival’s strongest LGBTQ-themed film.

Quentin Tarantino, who won Cannes’ top award for “Pulp Fiction,” attended the ceremony to present a tribute to filmmaker Roger Corman. Tarantino praised Corman for filling him and countless moviegoers with “unadulterated cinema pleasure.”
“My cinema is uninhibited, full of excess and fun,” said Corman, the independent film maverick. “I feel like this what Cannes is about.”
The festival’s Un Certain Regard section handed out its awards on Friday, giving the top prize to Molly Manning Walker’s debut feature, “How to Have Sex.”
Saturday’s ceremony drew to close a Cannes edition that hasn’t lacked spectacle, stars or controversy.
The biggest wattage premieres came out of competition. Martin Scorsese debuted his Osage murders epic “Killers of the Flower Moon,” a sprawling vision of American exploitation with Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone. “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” Harrison Ford’s Indy farewell, launched with a tribute to Ford. Wes Anderson premiered “Asteroid City.”
The festival opened on a note of controversy. “Jeanne du Barry,” a period drama co-starring Johnny Depp as Louis XV, played as the opening night film. The premiere marked Depp’s highest profile appearance since the conclusion of his explosive trial last year with ex-wife Amber Heard.
The selection of “Jeanne du Barry” added to criticisms of Cannes for being too hospitable to men accused of abusive behavior."
c8e3f33b-302a-4ff7-945f-78a913d3f10c,Labour to stand firm on net zero policies and attack cost of Tory retreat,"Labour will “double down” on making the case that tackling the cost of living crisis and the climate crisis can only be done in tandem, despite an intensifying Conservative attack on net zero policies, the Guardian has learned.
Labour will argue that seeking green growth is the way to bring down household bills and secure the future of the UK economy.
The party believes that Rishi Sunak’s dramatic U-turns last week on key net zero policies reveals a weakness in his strategy, in a lack of vision for future economic growth, and by adding to the cost of living for people on low incomes.
Ed Miliband, shadow secretary of state for energy security and net zero, told the Guardian: “Rishi Sunak is a man bankrupt of ideas who has shown this week he neither has answers to the cost of living crisis nor the climate crisis. His announcements will put up costs for working people, threaten investment and jobs, and lead to climate delay, loading more costs on to families.”
Some commentators have predicted that Labour would weaken its own stance in response. Miliband made clear the opposite was true.
“We relish the fight ahead on the question of who can really stand up for working people,” he said. “Labour’s plan will cut bills, create jobs, deliver energy security and tackle the climate crisis, while Rishi Sunak will leave Britain stuck in a doom loop of a permanent cost of living crisis and economic stagnation.”
Thinktanks and analysts have found that the impacts of the Tory reversals of key policies will be felt by people on lower incomes. The scrapping of a proposal to force private landlords to improve the insulation and energy efficiency of their rental properties will cost renters at least £1bn more a year in high heating bills and wasted energy, according to the Social Market Foundation.
The delay to the ban on petrol and diesel vehicles also carries a potential cost, as electric vehicles can save their owners thousands of pounds over their lifetimes. Sunak also weakened the proposed ban on new gas boilers from 2035, which will keep people hooked on expensive gas for longer, even as the cost of heat pumps is falling rapidly.
At the weekend, the BBC revealed that the government had closed down the energy efficiency taskforce, a group set up in March to help people gain access to insulation and more efficient heating.
Miliband said: “Every family is paying the price in higher energy bills, due to 13 years of Tory failure on insulating homes. After Sunak’s track record as chancellor with the disastrous green homes grant, this is another shortsighted decision that will cost families money.”
Emails from the Conservative party to journalists last week also revealed a Tory attack on Labour’s pledge of £28bn investment in a low-carbon economy.
But leading economists have argued for years that investing in low-carbon activities will be crucial for developed economies, as there are no viable alternatives for future growth.
Lord Stern, the cross-bench peer and professor at the London School of Economics, said in an interview: “Green growth is the economic growth story for the coming two to three decades. Clean is already cheaper than dirty across many parts of the economy, in energy, and increasingly in electric vehicles. Within seven years, we estimate that in 70% [of the global economy] clean will be cheaper than dirty.”
He said most of the innovation in modern economies was pouring into clean technology. “This is where we see investment going, and the pace of change is surprisingly fast.”

He warned that the UK risked missing out. “If you chop and change, you damage the confidence of investors and innovators. You reduce their trust,” he said.
There were also health benefits to the shift to a low-carbon world, Stern added. “We kill 35,000 people a year through dirty air, much of which comes from burning fossil fuels, and we maim many more. That is not only affects people’s lives, but reduces economic productivity.”
Political experts said Labour was right to emphasise green growth, and not follow the Tories into a “culture war” on the climate.
Tom Burke, a veteran government adviser and co-founder of the green thinktank E3G, warned Labour not to respond by weakening its own policies. “They should not fall for this trick,” he said. “Don’t look at the headlines in Tory newspapers [welcoming the prime minister’s U-turns], they do not reflect what Tory voters want. Labour should step up and show they have a positive story of investment.”
Shaun Spiers, executive director of the Green Alliance thinktank, said: “If Labour lose their nerve, they will look weak, like flip-floppers. They should make the case that energy efficiency, electric vehicles, low-carbon energy will all save people money and attract investment.”
A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “We have invested £6.6bn in energy efficiency upgrades this parliament, and will continue to support families in making their homes more efficient, helping them to cut bills while also achieving net zero in a pragmatic, proportionate and realistic way.”"

The woman who went viral for her outburst on an American Airlines flight is back — this time, with an ultra-glam Instagram post.
""One moment doesn't define you; but it can define your purpose,"" Tiffany Gomas wrote in an Instagram post on Sunday. Gomas is best known for having had an outburst on board an American Airlines flight: A video of her walking down a plane aisle and ranting about another passenger while looking visibly distressed was filmed and uploaded to TikTok in July.
The Texas-based marketing executive included a carousel of images in her post, showing herself in full glam, sitting barefoot on a kitchen floor. The post has been liked over 17,000 times as of press time. Gomas did not specify when the photoshoot took place.
Gomas debuted her new glam a week after uploading an apology video on YouTube and her other social media accounts. In that video, Gomas apologized for losing control of her emotions on the American Airlines flight. She also talked about finding a way to ""use this experience and do a little bit of good in the world.""
Her video ended with a line of text asking viewers to support her journey to promote mental wellness and to stand up against cyberbullying. She has yet to announce what she intends to do with her platform.
Gomas' latest Instagram post, however, has drawn mixed reactions from people on Instagram. Some have accused Gomas of trying to profit off her viral moment.
""Wait so now she is monetizing all this after acting like a victim in her last video?"" one person commented on her post.
""Using a meltdown to get famous and continuously posting about it,"" another person commented, along with the crying-laughing and facepalm emojis.
Some people, on the other hand, were supportive of her attempt to heal after the backlash she's faced.
""So true! Can't wait to see what's next for you! We've all had our bad days,"" said one person on Instagram.
""I'm glad you've taken this and used it in a positive way, happy for you!!!"" read another Instagram post.
But of course, other commentators were still fixated on what exactly Gomas saw on the plane that caused her to accuse a fellow passenger of being ""not real.""
""SoOOOO WHAT DID YOU SEE???"" someone asked Gomas on Instagram.
""What did you see? No one wanted to hear you say sorry lol,"" one person wrote on Instagram.
Representatives for Gomas did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider sent outside regular business hours."
325b270c-b924-4794-a2b3-f0594e728270,Park officials begin sand replenishment project at Doheny and Capistrano beaches,"State and local officials are looking to offset coastal erosion at a pair of Orange County beaches with enough sand to fill five Olympic-sized pools.
""We are proud to partner with the city of Dana Point and the County of Orange on this sand restoration effort,"" said Scott Kibbey, a state park superintendent. ""We look forward to this next phase of close collaboration with our project technical team members and community partners to achieve this monumental partnership project.""
California State Parks are working with Orange County and Dana Point officials to replenish sand at Doheny State Beach and Capistrano Beach Park after the powerful winter storms created tons of sand in the Santa River. The excess amount of sand would typically be dumped in a local landfill.

""The sand needed to be removed from the channel for flood conveyance and rather than let this beach-quality sand go to waste we reached out to our partners at Orange County Parks and State Parks to find out if they were able to use the sand to restore the beach,"" said Giles Matthews, an Orange County Public Works manager.
The joint project aims to dump 45,000 cubic yards of sand onto the beaches over the next four months.
County public works crews will bring in about 300-400 cubic yards of sand every weekday to the southern part of Doheny. The beaches will remain open to the public, but construction areas will be cordoned off to visitors."

Orland Park man facing battery, hate crime charges after dispute over garbage can
ORLAND PARK, Ill. (CBS) – A man was charged with hitting and making hateful comments against a neighboring Palestinian couple in Orland Park Wednesday morning.
Terrence P. Clyne, 68, was charged with one count of hate crime and two counts of battery, one for each victim.
Orland Park police said around 10:35 a.m., officers responded to a report of a battery in the 15400 block of Begonia Court where they learned of two battery victims and one suspect.
Investigation into the incident revealed Clyne allegedly battered one man after the victim moved garbage cans from one area of a communal driveway to another. It is further alleged that Clyne made hateful comments, referring to the victim's national Palestinian origin, in response to the garbage can placement before punching the victim in the face, police said.
The victim's wife then approached in an attempt to verbally de-escalate the situation when Clyne made more hateful comments aimed at her while mentioning her Palestinian heritage and moved toward her aggressively. The man stepped between Clyne and the woman and was again punched in the face and physically assaulted by Clyne - causing the victim to be pushed onto his wife.
The Cook County State's Attorney's Office assisted with the victim and witness interviews at the Orland Park Police Department.
Clyne is scheduled to appear before a judge at the Bridgeview Courthouse on Thursday."
9c44edbd-6a79-4def-a67f-e6c172898b92,A New Orleans magician says a Democratic operative paid him to make the fake Biden robocall,"NEW ORLEANS — A Democratic consultant who worked for a rival presidential campaign paid a New Orleans magician to use artificial intelligence to impersonate President Joe Biden for a robocall that is now at the center of a multistate law enforcement investigation, according to text messages, call logs and Venmo transactions the creator shared with NBC News.
Paul Carpenter says he was hired in January by Steve Kramer — who has worked on ballot access for Democratic presidential candidate Dean Phillips — to use AI software to make an imitation of Biden’s voice urging New Hampshire Democrats not to vote in the state’s presidential primary.
“I created the audio used in the robocall. I did not distribute it,” Carpenter said in an interview in New Orleans, where he is currently residing. “I was in a situation where someone offered me some money to do something, and I did it. There was no malicious intent. I didn’t know how it was going to be distributed.”
Carpenter — who holds world records in fork-bending and straitjacket escapes, but has no fixed address — showed NBC News how he created the fake Biden audio and said he came forward because he regrets his involvement in the ordeal and wants to warn people about how easy it is to use AI to mislead.
Creating the fake audio took less than 20 minutes and cost only $1, he said, for which he was paid $150, according to Venmo payments from Kramer and his father, Bruce Kramer, he shared.
“It’s so scary that it’s this easy to do,” Carpenter said. “People aren’t ready for it.”
Carpenter shared what he says is the original audio file created with Eleven Labs that appears to be a complete and higher quality version of the recording of the call NBC News previously reported.
The robocall has drawn intense attention from New Hampshire and federal law enforcement officials for possibly violating state voter suppression and federal telecom laws. Officials have mentioned the name of a Dallas company that was used to place the automatic phone calls to voters ahead of the state’s primary and have vowed to investigate, citing a desire to make an example of those involved in the first known example of an AI-generated deepfake being deployed maliciously in an American political campaign. Authorities have not named Carpenter or Steve Kramer as targets of their investigation.
The players
Steve Kramer is a longtime political operative, having worked for dozens of campaigns over 20 years including rapper Ye’s (formerly Kanye West) 2020 presidential campaign.
Kramer initially did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Days later, he said he would wait to speak on the matter until he publishes something on Saturday. ""My op-Ed will explain all,"" he said in a text.
The Phillips campaign and the candidate himself expressed outrage when asked about Steve Kramer’s alleged involvement, saying they would never work with him again and may pursue legal action if the allegations are confirmed.
NBC News has seen no evidence that the campaign directed Steve Kramer to produce or disseminate the robocall.

Federal Election Commission records show Steve Kramer was paid $259,946 by Phillips' campaign in December and January. The payments were for ballot access work in New York and Pennsylvania, which includes canvassing for the signatures necessary to qualify for the ballot. The campaign said the work included production and distribution of a robocall that featured Phillips’ voice.
Payments listed in their campaign finance filings indicated Steve Kramer did get-out-the-vote work
“If it is true that Mr. Kramer had any involvement in the creation of deepfake robocalls, he did so of his own volition which had nothing to do with our campaign,” said Phillips press secretary Katie Dolan. “The fundamental notion of our campaign is the importance of competition, choice, and democracy. We are disgusted to learn that Mr. Kramer is allegedly behind this call, and if the allegations are true, we absolutely denounce his actions.”
Phillips’ campaign said its relationship with Steve Kramer ended several weeks ago, after he completed his contract to gather signatures to help the candidate get on the ballot in his assigned states and there have had been no communication with him by late Thursday.
The magician and the political consultant
Carpenter, who was born in Houston, and calls himself a “digital nomad artist of life,” did not expect to end up in the middle of a national political scandal when he says he met Steve Kramer last year.
“The only thing missing from the political circus is a magician and here I am,” said Carpenter, who also hosts a podcast, has created mentalism instructional videos and says has performed in 24 countries.
In the past few years, he said he's been building computer programs and experimenting with NFTs, content creation, and AI.
He rides a motorcycle with his Dachshund-Chihuahua mix, who wears dog goggles. His political views are eccentric.
He speaks of his belief in right-wing conspiracy theories like the “deep state” and has ""some issues"" with the first moon landing, but also says he staged a performance art piece where he placed a porcelain toilet on former President Donald Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and pretended to defecate on it.
He has staged several such stunts meant to provoke, he says, such as one in which he wore only a fig leaf in Times Square as an expression of “radical authenticity,” and another in which he filmed himself portraying various American archetypes, including a white supremacist with a swastika on his forehead, which he says was about showing that we are all human, despite how much we may hate each other.

He and Steve Kramer were introduced through a mutual acquaintance, for whom he had done some web design and social media management work, Carpenter said, and took an interest in his experience with AI.
Carpenter said he believed Kramer was working for the people whose voices he was being asked to imitate and that the voice projects were authorized by the campaigns. He had not heard of Phillips and said he was not aware of Kramer's work for the candidate.
The first two projects impersonated Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., apparently to be used in robo-polls asking GOP presidential primary voters which candidate they supported, Carpenter said. The third was the fake Biden audio telling Democrats not to turn out in New Hampshire.
“Have AI voice project,” Steve Kramer texted Carpenter on Sept. 27, according to text messages Carpenter shared with NBC News. The phone number in those text messages for Steve Kramer matched an online records search and it was also confirmed while reaching out to him for comment. Steve Kramer then sent Carpenter an audio sample of the South Carolina senator’s voice and said he would send a “script for Prez poll to match w the aforementioned SC voice.”
In January, three days before the New Hampshire presidential primary, Steve Kramer texted Carpenter again, saying he had emailed him a script. For payment, Steve Kramer then directed Carpenter to his father, Bruce Kramer, for reasons unknown to Carpenter.
Venmo transactions show an account with the name Bruce Kramer paid Carpenter $150 in two transactions on Jan. 20.
“I have nothing to say on the subject,” Bruce Kramer said in a brief telephone interview on Thursday.
On Jan. 22, when NBC News first broke the news of the fake Biden robocall, Steve Kramer texted Carpenter a link to the story along with the message, “Shhhhhhh,” to which Carpenter replied, “Gtfooh,” an acronym used to express astonishment.
Screenshots of call logs show numerous back-and-forth phone calls between Steve Kramer and Carpenter over the next several hours. Carpenter says he complied with Steve Kramer’s request to delete their entire email correspondence, which he says included the scripts for the fake Biden robocall and other instructions.
A veteran Democratic strategist who does not know Kramer personally received an urgent message from him Jan. 30 asking to speak about the Biden robocall. The operative, who requested anonymity to speak about the private conversation, did not respond.
Who is Steve Kramer?
Steve Kramer, the president of his own small firm, is a get-out-the-vote specialist who has worked on dozens of mostly Democratic campaigns over the past 20 year, including some high-profile ones. He has extensive experience with robocalls, according to state and federal campaign finance records.
Previously based in New York, he has a history of working in New York City politics. His Facebook page shows him frequently on vacation and enjoying nightlife in New Orleans or Miami in a loud shirt with a drink in hand.
Kramer has worked on numerous major campaigns, but this is not his first brush with controversy.
In 2020, he worked for the independent presidential campaign of the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, helping him with ballot access in several states and speaking on the record as a top strategist for the campaign. West ended up having problems over his ballot access in three states and was also criticized for his comments about slavery.
In 2021, a former client, Sara Tirschwell, a Republican who had been running for mayor of New York City, sued Kramer. She accused him of sabotaging her campaign by delivering signatures that ended up being mostly invalid, preventing her from getting on the ballot. He has refused to comment on pending litigation but denied the accusations in court filings and the case remains open.
He was also involved in Nomiki Konst’s 2019 campaign for New York City public advocate that led her former compliance officer to file a formal complaint with the city campaign finance agency on mysterious payments to a Louisiana firm with which Steve Kramer was involved. Konst has contended the complaint was entirely political and has been locked in litigation with the compliance officer, who then sued her for defamation.
How the deepfake was made
Carpenter showed NBC News how he created the imitation of Biden’s voice, using a reporter’s voice as a stand-in to avoid violating the AI platform’s terms of service agreements against the unauthorized use of a person’s voice.
He used Eleven Labs, an AI text-to-speech voice generator that has been identified by an NBC News analysis and outside experts as the tool used to create the Biden robocall. He also used other mostly free AI tools to show how he could add the audio to a video of a person talking and animate their lips to match.
“I’m not showing you anything you can’t learn how to do on YouTube,” Carpenter said.
Carpenter also demonstrated that his previous Eleven Labs account, linked to his main email address, was shut down by the company with a message saying, “We have closed your account due to unusual activity.”” Carpenter said the account was locked days after NBC News first broke the story, which is consistent with a Bloomberg report that Eleven Labs banned the account that created the robocall audio on Jan. 26.
He is being represented pro-bono by an attorney he found on Reddit, Brandon Kizy, a criminal defense and First Amendment attorney based in Detroit.
“Paul had no prior knowledge of what the AI-generated content would be used for and Paul did not have any knowledge that it would be used to potentially affect or be used in connection with any election or voter activity,"" Kizy said.
So far, the public portion of the law enforcement investigation into the calls has focused on a Texas telemarketing company that they say distributed the robocalls. New Hampshire authorities have said they’ve asked federal officials to examine whether the calls violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act; the Truth in Caller ID Act; and the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act.
The fake Biden calls reached between 5,000 and 25,000 people and “spoofed” the originating number, according to authorities, to appear on caller ID as if they were coming from the former chairperson of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, who was running a pro-Biden write-in campaign at the time.
“We have never seen something so close to an election before and with such a blatant attempt to mislead voters,” New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella said earlier this month. “We don’t want this to be the first of many.”"

6171dd6d-4562-4ef0-a8a3-121251cd8591,Denver mayor boasts 'shared sacrifice' is required to make city 'welcoming' for migrants,"Denver Democratic Mayor Mike Johnston conceded there would be ""shared sacrifice"" to reach the sanctuary city's goal of being a ""welcoming"" place for illegal immigrants.
The mayor's remarks came during a CNBC interview for its ""Cities of Success"" series that aired on April 11 and was originally filmed in February.
Around 40,000 migrants have arrived in Denver since last year, primarily from Texas. The surge has strained city resources and forced Johnston to cut millions from the budget in order to accommodate the migrants.
In the recent CNBC interview, host Carl Quintanilla asked Johnston to respond to residents who are angered by Denver's ""generous"" sanctuary city policy.
DENVER CITY OFFICIAL CAUGHT ON CAMERA BEGGING MIGRANTS TO LEAVE, HEAD TO CHICAGO, NYC: ‘GOING TO SUFFER’
Johnston defended Denver's policy as a ""balanced"" approach to dealing with the crisis without having any federal aid.
""It's a balance. We want to be a welcoming city,"" Johnston began.
He explained how he did not want migrant families to be left out in the cold on the streets, but he also wanted to provide high quality public services for taxpayers.
""In this context, without any support to do both of those things, [it] requires shared sacrifice, it requires compromise. So, we are both making cuts to city budgets to meet this financial need, and we are making cuts to the amount of services we can provide to the migrants that arrive and to the number of folks that we can serve,"" he continued.
800 MIGRANT FAMILIES BEING BOOTED FROM DENVER SHELTERS AS CITY NEARS BREAKING POINT
In March, city officials pleaded with property owners to ""house"" migrants after it scaled back some of its migrant services to reduce the budget deficit.
Mayor Johnston announced last week that nearly $46 million would be slashed from the budget to help fund a $90 million package funding migrant aid and housing for the rest of the year, Fox31 reported.
The Mayor's Office is taking the biggest cut at 9.6%, followed by a 6.1% cut from the Climate Action, Sustainability and Resiliency Department. There were also several other reported cuts, including to the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure, City Attorney's Office, Sheriff's Department, Police Department and Public Library.
Johnston previously predicted the crisis would cost the city around $180 million in 2024.

94ce3e9f-2466-438e-89be-1e098c00c4ba,"Martinez announces plans for revamped, revitalized waterfront","MARTINEZ - Martinez may be known for many things, but its waterfront might not immediately jump to mind. City officials are planning on changing that perception in the near future.
""A restaurant,"" said Mayor Brianne Zorn, for starters. ""We'll have a fully remastered harbormaster office. We'll have an updated bait shop. We will have an environmental center and conference center and a café.""
Looking through the glare on her laptop, Zorn can see a future the city of Martinez has talked about for a long time now. A refurbished marina, an improved waterfront, and better access to the wildlife refuge and parkland that surrounds it all.
""And it's got some ideas about, you know, what it is that we're envisioning this area to look like,"" she said of the plans.
The city is now finalizing a blueprint for approval by the state, and the project would - by necessity, be transformative..
""What the plan dictates is that we actually have to raise this whole area by several feet and they don't specify how we're gonna do that,"" Zorn said. ""They just know that due to projections from sea level rise building at this elevation is not in our best interest.""
""So this is Cush,"" said Richard, pulling the young puppy from his car in a marina parking lot. ""We found her at two months old out here at the Martinez Marina in the dumpster.""
Just as the Martinez Waterfront may be heading for a transition, it's currently home to a collection of people who find themselves in between places.
""Losing my job at Amazon,"" Richard said. ""Tried to do side work as a mechanic. It's just been hard since then. I've been out here since December.""
Richard was born and raised in Contra Costa County. He's among those staying here until he finds work again.
""Sometimes on the weekends, we come out here and do barbecue with each other and try to scrounge up our money to buy some food for each other,"" he said of those living on the waterfront. ""It's a beautiful place. I know I agree with developing out here. Yes, I am worried about losing my spot, but honestly it's very underestimated out here.""
The city says it's working with the county on assistance for those living here, but construction is not imminent. The improvements, and any development, could only come after massive infrastructure upgrades.
""First step is the fishing pier,"" Zorn said of the rebuild. ""Second step is the eastern seawall and the outer sheet pile wall around the marina.""
What's driving the city's additional room to maneuver on the waterfront is actually a change in how they dredge the marina on the Carquinez strait. For years, the waste was vacuumed up and simply dumped into holding ponds.
With that policy having changed a few years ago, Martinez is hoping to clean up the forming dumping areas and incorporate them with the rest of the waterfront. The scope of the project doesn't threaten to upend the area more than it needs to, though bigger things may come later down the line.
""We are one of the cities along the Carquinez strait that has been proposed for ferry service that connects us to the other cities in the region, and to the greater San Francisco Bay area by boat,"" Zorn said. ""We're connected by rail. We could also be connected by Bart. They're all of these opportunities for us to be connected to the region.""
It's an ambitious project that hopes to better connect Martinez to the water, and its past glory as a regional hub."
6986f012-2acd-403e-b4de-ab25c250de05,"Nayib Bukele Declares One-Party Rule, Opposition 'Pulverized' in El Salvador Presidential Election","The president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, declared himself the winner of a second five-year term in office on Sunday with an overwhelming 85 percent of the vote, declaring the nation’s opposition “pulverized” and El Salvador the world’s first democratic one-party system.
Bukele was first elected the presidency in 2019 under the New Ideas party, a third party that made history by defeating the two-party establishment of the left-wing Farabundo Martí National Liberation Party (FMLN) and the right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA). Prior to founding New Ideas, Bukele was a longtime member of FMLN, but was expelled in 2017 for “defamatory acts” against the party.
Following his first inauguration, Bukele immediately launched a nationwide campaign against El Salvador’s notorious gang-fueled violence, which featured high-profile battles with the federal legislature, the National Assembly, and the courts.
Bukele’s party controversially replaced the entirety of the Supreme Court in 2021 and the nation’s attorney general and expanded the executive’s power through a “state of exception” decree in March 2022 that restricted some constitutional rights in exchange for expanding police authority to apprehend gang suspects. It also allowed Bukele to build “mega-prisons” for tens of thousands of gang members, facilitating their removal from the streets.
Presidency of the Republic of El Salvador via Storyful
The gang crackdown, even critics concede, has been a resounding success, fueling Bukele’s outsized popularity. Salvadoran newspaper El Faro, the most prominent critical voice against Bukele in the country, published a report which has been critical of Bukele’s administration, reported in February 2023 that gangs have virtually “disappeared.” While the state of exception limited some freedom of assembly, the destruction of the gangs expanded previously unexercised freedoms by allowing for the restoration of activities deemed normal in free countries, such as small businesses operating without having to pay extortion fees to gangs or families safely using public parks.
“Yes, they have ruined the gangs as you knew them. If what you mean to ask is whether there are no longer any cipotes [gang members] with presence in these places, it’s true,” an anonymous former gang leader told the newspaper. “They’re no longer there. If you want to see it that way, then yes: they have ruined the gangs.”
Bukele himself declared that he had defeated both the ARENA and FMLN candidates on Sunday by a margin unseen in the history of global democracy – leading skeptics to question the legitimacy of the numbers – but months of polling prior to the election indicated that a similar number of Salvadorans indeed intended to vote for the incumbent.
“On this day, El Salvador has broken all records of all democracies in all the history of the world – since democracy began, never has a campaign won by the number of votes that we have won today,” Bukele declared on Sunday. “It is literally the largest percentage in all of history. It is the largest difference between the first and second place in all of history. And not only have we won the presidency of the republic for a second time, with over 85 perccent of the vote, but we have won the legislative assembly with 58 out of 60 representatives, at a minimum.”
Bukele had also announced these election results on his Twitter account before the national electoral authority had published any results.
“According to our numbers, we have won the presidential election with over 85 percent of the vote and a minimum of 58 out of the 60 representatives in the Assembly,” he wrote. “The record in the democratic history of the world.”
De acuerdo a nuestros números, hemos ganado la elección presidencial con más del 85% de los votos y un mínimo de 58 de 60 diputados de la Asamblea. El récord en toda la historia democrática del mundo. Nos vemos a las 9pm frente al Palacio Nacional. Dios bendiga a El Salvador. — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) February 5, 2024
In his speech, on the balcony of San Salvador’s national palace, Bukele asserted, “It will be the first time that in a country exists one party in a fully democratic system. All of the opposition, together, was pulverized.”
“In 2019, we defeated the two-party system, which had us in submission, and we turned the page. We ended the post-war era, he continued, “but we had no ability to govern. Remember how we fought with the Assembly back then? They didn’t let us do anything good for the people.”
“In 2021,” he recalled, “you gave us not a simple majority – which they said was impossible to achieve – but a full majority in the legislative assembly, with which we could, the people of El Salvador and its representatives, expel the former constitutional court, expel the former prosecutor general, approve what we needed for the territorial control plan.”
“In March 2022, approve the state of exception,” he said, to raucous applause.
The replacement of the justices on the constitional court, in addition to allowing for the state of exception to limit constitutional rights, also allowed Bukele to run for reelection. The Salvadoran constitution explicitly bans presidents from running for more than one term in the highest office, but the court ruled in 2021 that Bukele could run for office again so long as he resigned six months before the end of his term. Bukele did so – leaving the country officially in the hands of his former secretary, Claudia Juana Rodríguez de Guevara, who assumed the office in December.
Bukele addressed critics who questioned the legality and democratic rigor of his election during his speech.
“Some who do not live in our country, who don’t know El Salvador – who haven’t even passed through here on a layover flight – they say that Salvadorans live oppressed,” Bukele said, arousing cheers in the audience, “that Salvadorans don’t want the state of exception. That Salvadorans live in fear of the government.”
“I tell the journalists accompanying us tonight, in total liberty and total security, here in the safest country in the Western Hemisphere: don’t beleive me,” he continued. “I’m just a politician, I’m just an official. Believe the Salvadoran people who are telling you here in this square, who told you in every national and international poll, including the opposition polls and – just in case you didn’t believe them – told you in these elections.”
“The Salvadoran people have spoken, not just loud and clear, but spoke in the most decisive way in teh history of de3mocracy in the entire world,” he concluded. “If that doesn’t convince you – journalists, NGO workers, international NGO works, UN workers, OEA [Organization of American States] workers, nothing will convince you.”
El Faro, the opposition newspaper, expressed concerns about Bukele’s claim to 85-percent election support and the Supreme Electoral Tribunal – the national government institution tasked with counting votes.
“Until about 10 at night, the Tribunal offered partial data, but without context,” the newspaper reported. “With 22 percent of votes processed, Bukele appeared with 1,090,522 votes; and, below him, with 93,846 votes, at a distant second, the FMLN candidate Manuel Flores.”
“The data offered by the Tribunal appeared inconsistent, as if that number of votes represented 22 percent, that meant that practically 100 perccent of people voted for Bukele,” El Faro contended.
Ultimately, however, the complaints about Bukele stem from the ouster of the Supreme Court justices and accusations of “gerrymandering,” far from uncommon practices in other nations widely considered free and democratic. Polls released ahead of the election were also not inconsistent with the results as Bukele announced them.
Polls released by El Salvador’s Central American University in January found that 81.9 percent of voters inteded to choose Bukele. January’s numbers represented a significant increase from his already dominating performance in polls throughout the summer. In August 2023, the Center for Citizen Studies (CEC) at Francisco Gavidia University published a poll showing 68.4 percent of voters would choose Bukele. The same poll predicted that New Ideas would obtain 58 out of the National Assembly’s 60 seats, the exact margin Bukele announced on Sunday night.

Lord Sentamu immediately rejected the conclusions of the report, saying the author, an experienced safeguarding investigator, had a “fundamental misunderstanding” of the responsibilities of bishops and archbishops.
In 2013, Sentamu acknowledged a letter from the victim detailing the sexual abuse with the words: “Please be assured of my prayers and best wishes during this testing time.”
The C of E commissioned the report to examine how it handled allegations by Matthew Ineson that he was repeatedly raped as a teenager in the 1980s by Trevor Devamanikkam, who later killed himself.
The C of E is not expected to impose sanctions on any individual as a result of the review’s findings. Ineson said Sentamu, who retired in 2020 as the C of E’s second most senior official, should be banned from officiating within the church.
Ineson, who was ordained as a priest but no longer serves, refused to cooperate with the review on the grounds that it was not independent.
On Thursday he accused the C of E of hypocrisy. “Yesterday, the archbishop of Canterbury was lecturing on morality, but the church he leads is still covering up rape and abuse and protecting bishops at any cost,” he said.
Ineson said he reported the abuse verbally to various bishops and other senior clergy, whom he identified, in 2012 and 2013 but no action was taken.
He then wrote two letters to Steven Croft, the then bishop of Sheffield and now bishop of Oxford, copying them to Sentamu, in which he said he had “suffered sexual abuse as a youth by a priest” and complained that his disclosures had been ignored.
The review found there was evidence that Ineson had made disclosures to some of the senior clergy he had identified and they had “failed to act on them”.
In 2016, Ineson lodged formal complaints of misconduct against four bishops and the archbishop, which were dismissed by the church.
The following year, Devamanikkam was found dead at his home the day before he was due to appear in court on three counts of buggery and three counts of indecent assault relating to Ineson’s allegations.
The report says that although Devamanikkam did not face a trial, the reviewer “can confirm the survivor was sexually abused” by him.
Some senior clergy “prioritised their own involvement” relating to Ineson’s formal misconduct complaints against them over safeguarding issues.
The report adds: “There appears to be reluctance on the part of some senior clergy to formally apologise to the survivor.”
It recommends that the C of E make such an apology for its failings, and ensure Ineson “has the support and counselling he needs in order to rebuild his life”.
Jane Humphreys, the reviewer, said: “It takes a lot of courage to disclose abuse and to not receive the right support and guidance at the time he disclosed his abuse is inexcusable.”
Joanne Grenfell, the bishop of Stepney, who leads on safeguarding, said the church “should be ashamed” of its failure to respond properly, adding: “We are truly sorry.”
In a lengthy statement released by the C of E alongside the report, Sentamu said: “I find myself in an unenviable position of having to reject the opinions of the reviewer … This is due to a fundamental misunderstanding on her part of the jurisdictional, pastoral and legal responsibilities of diocesan bishops and archbishops in the C of E.”
He said the reviewer’s stated opinion that individuals must act on safeguarding issues regardless of church law was “odd and troubling”. He added: “Safeguarding is very important but it does not trump church law.”
On Thursday, Croft wrote to all clergy in the diocese of Oxford saying he had “made a mistake in my safeguarding practice. That mistake was costly for the survivor and for this I am very sorry.”
Since waiving his right to anonymity, Ineson has become one of the most persistent and outspoken critics of the church over its shortcomings in dealing with cases of sexual abuse. He previously gave evidence to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse."

What do I do with my solar eclipse glasses?
PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — Now that the solar eclipse is over, it's time to figure out what to do with those safety glasses.
Some places in Western Pennsylvania are asking for them so they can give other people a chance to see the wonder we were treated to on Monday.
Now that it's over, people don't have much use for their eclipse glasses. But there is a better option than tossing the glasses in the trash can.
""People we know gave us ISO-approved glasses so those should definitely go to somebody else,"" Elias Salyers said.
The American Astronomical Society said all glasses compliant with ISO 12312-2 can be used for another eclipse.
Plum Borough is urging people to donate their glasses at the municipal complex to be reused. The Plum Recycling Committee will then send them to Astronomers Without Borders, which will give them to teachers and people hosting events for future eclipses.
""I had absolutely no idea that there was an eclipse coming up for somewhere else,"" Abby Weispfenning said. ""So, I think that is absolutely fabulous, a great option and super easy to donate. For anyone to have that experience, it would be phenomenal.""
Mars Area School District starts its collection on Wednesday. The glasses will go to Eclipse Glasses USA and be given to children in Latin America for an October eclipse there.
""Everyone who can't afford the glasses, I want them to be able to have them,"" James Salyers said."

What was once bought for a mere $4 at a Savers in Manchester, New Hampshire, just sold for $191,000 at an auction.
Found in a stack of mostly damaged prints and posters was a heavy and dusty painting of two women in front of a religious statue, one with a stern face. Looking for old frames to repurpose, the thriftier tossed it into their cart, completely unaware of what they discovered.
After hanging in her bedroom for a few years, the oil painting was eventually stored away in a closet. At one point, she even joked about it being a real painting after not finding any results during a quick internet search, but never really gave it a second thought.
Then, in May, while doing some spring cleaning, the unknown thriftier came across the painting again and decided to post some photos of it on Facebook. She was quickly referred to the Brandywine Museum of Art in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, as well as a conservator -- who drove three hours just to view the painting in person.
As it turns out, the work of art that was bought for just a few dollars roughly six years earlier was actually a legitimate and valuable piece by the American painter and illustrator, Newell Convers Wyeth, also known as N.C. Wyeth.
The long-lost painting, identified as Ramona, is one of four illustrations Wyeth made for the 1939 edition of the Helen Hunt Jackson novel, according to the auctioneer Bonhams Skinner. It depicts the tension between Ramona and her mother Señora Moreno.

Only one other of the four illustrations has been located.
As for that frame that initially caught the thriftier's eye, well, it is said that it was chosen by Wyeth in an effort to protect the edges and corners of the artwork while it was sent by train from his home in Chadds Ford to studio publishers in either Philadelphia or New York, Bonhams Skinner said."

Jennings introduced the category for the Double Jeopardy! round titled: ""That's Misleading.""

Plummer seemed stumped, and he stammered ""Something ramp?"" before shaking his head.
The timer ran out and Jennings said Plummer was incorrect before revealing ""Rampart"" was the correct answer.

Former Oasis singer Liam Gallagher, 50, has a mini-me. His son Lennon, 24, is the spitting image of the “Wonderwall” singer.
A new photo of Lennon shows the true extent of their resemblance, particularly the father’s and son’s similar facial features.
Lennon is the son of Liam and actress Patsy Kensit, who was married to Liam from 1997 to 2000. The rock star’s look-alike son was named after his dad’s favorite member of The Beatles, John Lennon.
He’s modeled during London fashion week and for Vogue. He’s also a musician, playing guitar in the band Automation.

He told the Daily Mail that he got scouted as a model at the age of 16.
“I was walking in Brick Lane, and I was like, 16. I just got an army jacket and I was walking away from the store. This woman pulled me over and was like, ‘You should be a model, take this card. We have a shoot in Africa, you should do it.’ I didn’t do the shoot because it seemed really sketchy, so I told my mum and she was like, ‘If you want to get into it, I know some people.'”
Lennon also told the outlet that he has an uneasy relationship with fame.
“You’re traced everywhere online. There’s no real privacy. It’s kind of paranoia-inducing,” he said.

All of the children strongly resemble their famous parent, but Lennon might look the most like his dad.

Liam has previously stated that he hadn’t met his daughter for much of their lives.
“I’ve just never got around to meeting her,” he told the Mirror about Molly. “I’ve heard she’s all right, though. She’s doing all right.”

Singer Robbie Williams, who was engaged to Appleton before Liam, said that at the height of Oasis’ fame, the group acted as “gigantic bullies” to the “whole industry.”
“Everybody in it — and I didn’t like that. A lot of that still remains inside me,” he said. “They’re probably different people now, but there’s a lot of me that’s like, ‘They’re f – – king bullies, them.’ I don’t like bullies.”
Lennon is just the latest celebrity kid (or “nepo baby”) to bear a startling resemblance to their famous parent. Reese Witherspoon’s daughter, Ava Phillippe, 24, also looks like a clone of her mom, and the internet was startled by a glimpse of Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck’s daughter, Violet, 17, who looked like her mom’s twin while attending a Hamptons bash hosted by Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin in July."
72e6c22e-306e-44aa-8d89-ad867ad0dd37,Dutch Bishops Reject Vatican Opening to Blessing Same-Sex Couples,"ROME — The Dutch bishops, once known for their progressive leanings, have collectively rejected the Vatican’s recent opening to the blessing of same-sex couples.
While embracing the Vatican’s call for “closeness and accompaniment” for persons living in a homosexual relationship and for re-married divorced persons, the Dutch bishops reject the novelty of blessing gay couples introduced by the Vatican’s December 18 text titled Fiducia Supplicans.
In their 292-word response to Fiducia Supplicans, the bishops note that it is possible to say a prayer over individual believers living in an irregular relationship, something the Catholic Church has always held.
“In this prayer, God can be asked for strength and assistance under the invocation of His Spirit, so that he/she may understand God’s will with his/her life and continue to grow,” they state, in a clear distinction from blessing the couple itself.
Sister Jeannine Gramick, cofounder of the pro-LGBTQQIAAP2S+ group New Ways Ministry, has been denied the title “Catholic” by Church authorities. Pope Francis just welcomed her at the Vatican, and Gramick praised “his openness to blessing same-sex unions."" https://t.co/lyLQwdtUK8 — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) October 18, 2023
“This makes it clear in the wording chosen that this is not a blessing or confirmation of an irregular relationship and also avoids confusion with marriage, which, according to the Catholic Church, can only be between a man and a woman,” they add.
In this statement, the Dutch bishops effectively revert to the prior Vatican teaching that individual persons can be blessed but irregular relationships cannot.
In its 2021 statement in this regard, the Vatican’s doctrinal office said that blessings may be “given to individual persons with homosexual inclinations, who manifest the will to live in fidelity to the revealed plans of God as proposed by Church teaching,” whereas it would be illicit to confer “any form of blessing that tends to acknowledge their unions as such.”
God Himself “does not and cannot bless sin,” that statement asserted, and thus “the Church does not have, and cannot have, the power to bless unions of persons of the same sex.”
The Dutch bishops are the latest ecclesiastical conference to take issue with the novel teaching of Fiducia Supplicans, which seems to many to contradict the Church’s constant moral teaching on the matter.
The African bishops’ conferences, as well as the bishops’ conferences in Hungary, Poland, and Kazakhstan have all refused the Vatican’s call to allow non-liturgical blessings to people in irregular relationships.
For their part, the French bishops’ conference embraced Fiducia Supplicans but nine French bishops publicly dissented from the demand to bless same-sex couples.

Springfield Public Schools board member Shurita Thomas-Tate suggested that the board draft a statement at a school board meeting on Tuesday. When making a case for an LGBTQ statement, Thomas-Tate said that students of the LGBTQ community expressed that they don’t feel ""safe.""

""I personally would like for us to have a resolution and the reason why I think a resolution is necessary because we do have a subset of our student population who have voiced significant concern about their welcoming environment,"" Thomas-Tate said.
She added that it does not ""cost"" the board anything to ensure that a certain demographic of students feel supported.
The effort to draft a statement began earlier in the year.

Community members started an online petition in January demanding that Springfield Public Schools (SPS) ""vote on making a statement of support for the queer students and staff who are enrolled in/work for the SPS"" throughout the academic year.
Furthermore, the petition called on the SPS Board to vote on a draft statement submitted by Dr. Kyler J. Sherman-Wilkins during a board meeting on September 6.
The petition cites statistics saying that 1/5 of Gen Z students identify within the LGBTQ+ community and that over 65% say they experienced bullying or feel unsafe at school. Moreover, 45% of them have suicidal thoughts or attempts.
The petition garnered nearly 400 signatures.

""We believe that while such a statement does not address all of the concerns faced by queer students and staff, it is a necessary first step to ensuring that said students and staff are welcomed and supported at SPS. We demand this action be taken immediately,"" the petition reads.
However, the board did not work in their favor after other board members disagreed with the suggestion.
Board member Steve Makoski who ""prepared a statement"" in response to the resolution pushed back on the suggestion to draft an LGBTQ+ affirming statement, prompting applause.
""As a member of this prestigious board, I'm not here to push forward an agenda of sexual identity, GLO...rainbow clubs, MAGA groups, Pride, NRA, NAACP, or any other group or faction,"" Makoski said.
He continued, ""This resolution is nothing more than a distraction for our school system.""
Makoski went on to say, ""I view this resolution as an attack on these four walls by activists...who constantly try to distract this board from its mission and vision.""
""I did not become a member of this board to help facilitate activists and their agenda.""
SPS did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment."
fc08147c-a634-48c2-ac53-cb32d49a34d7,Look at the crisis in the Amazon and understand the stakes: we’re battling for life itself,"Some of the most fulfilling moments in my life as an actor are when I play roles that speak to the challenges facing humanity. In The Avengers, for example, in which I play the Hulk, the team tries to undo the “the snap” – an apocalyptic event brought about by the villain Thanos to eradicate half of all living beings.
As a good friend of mine says: “Fantasy is not an escape from our world, but an invitation to go deeper into it.” The simple fact is that humanity has triggered extinction events – and the collapse of the Amazon is a disaster that will be terrible for all of us in real life.
We are on the brink of what scientists are calling a “tipping point” for the Amazon basin, meaning that the destruction will get to a point where the forest can no longer regenerate. This is Earth’s endgame. Over 10,000 species could be wiped out, starting a domino effect that would affect our planet’s climate, our water, and food supplies everywhere – taking many human lives with it. So even if you live on the other side of the globe, this is very much your problem, too.
Scientists tell us that we don’t have much time to reverse this – and to do so, we must protect 80% of the Amazon and sustainably manage the other 20%.

The good news is that there are real-life Avengers showing us the way. Because while we have been playing at consuming and destroying, Indigenous peoples have been conserving almost all biodiversity this planet still holds. No joke: 80% of the planet’s remaining biodiversity is on Indigenous land. Silently, they have proven that the smartest way to save us all is to recognise and protect their territories. But tragically, these Indigenous peoples are being removed, attacked and even killed by multiple villains: hostile governments, powerful lobbies, trafficking, loggers and mining.
And this coming week, they will face an important battle: the Amazon summit. Leaders from all Amazon countries will gather in Brazil to decide the future of the forest. And our Amazon saviours will be fighting to guarantee we get all the protections we need.
Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk in Avengers Assemble
It is time for reinforcements to arrive from all sides, and for all of us to realise and come to terms with how high the stakes are. Indigenous wisdom says that the decisions we make today should result in a sustainable world seven generations into the future. This is a calling from the children of the generations that will follow us. We are all being asked to assemble and awaken what is heroic in us. Let’s pledge together to help them.
We need to turn all eyes to the Amazon summit as a decisive moment for the whole world. The best way to do this is by making leaders aware that we are all watching what they do. And that public gaze is already bearing fruit. In July, thanks to action by the new Brazilian government, deforestation fell by at least 60% compared to the same month last year. Now we need them to commit to recognising Indigenous territories and protecting 80% of the forest now, in line with scientific recommendations.
I’ve heard it said that there used to be many “environmental issues”. But now, it’s all one struggle: for life itself. Such a struggle reminds me of Avengers: Endgame barrelling towards its conclusion and of the 14,000,605 timelines that Doctor Strange witnesses: of all of them, there was only one in which they won.
The odds were stacked against them just as they appear to be against us. But as with the Avengers, only our actions together can beat the odds so that life on Earth wins. Let’s do this."

Wade was a bigger threat to civil liberty than the COVID-19 lockdowns.
Democratic Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania made the comments about the Dobbs decision during a hearing held by the House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on the Constitution and Limited Government titled “Liberty, Tyranny, and Accountability: Covid-19 and the Constitution.” Scanlon accused Republicans of backing the “subjugation of women” in her opening remarks during the hearing. (RELATED: ‘We Were Censored’ By White House For Pointing Out ‘Huge Problems’ With COVID Vaccines, Tucker Carlson Says)
“You can’t have a hearing about tyranny without acknowledging that a person being denied medical care because of someone else’s political or religious beliefs is certainly an exercise of tyranny,” Scanlon claimed. “Since the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade two years ago, state legislatures nationwide have passed laws that threaten women’s reproductive health care with medically unnecessary restrictions.”
WATCH:
“One in three women of reproductive age lives in a state with an abortion ban. Doctors and pharmacists, doing their jobs, and even women who suffer miscarriages have been threatened with criminal charges,” Scanlon continued. “Women who are denied access to healthcare are vulnerable to harm and even sometimes death. To be clear, the Supreme Court’s misguided Dobbs decision did not take away a woman’s underlying right to the freedom to make our own reproductive healthcare decisions, but it did take away important legal protection.”
The hearing touched on damage done by lockdowns, including the learning loss and high absentee rates caused by the closing of schools for in-person learning, and also touched on censorship of opposing viewpoints on COVID-19.
“Today’s hearing is a destructive exercise of revisionist history. So let’s try to correct the record a little bit. Four years ago, our public health officials faced a daunting crisis, the global spread of COVID-19. I find it very disturbing that the majority in its effort to cast legitimate public health measures as tyranny just showed a very misleading video, in which they also tried to blame the Biden administration for actions which were implemented under the Trump administration.”
The Biden administration asked Facebook to censor then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson, a co-founder of the Daily Caller and Daily Caller News Foundation, over Carlson saying that COVID-19 vaccines did not work, according to documents released by then-Republican Attorney General Jeff Landry of Louisiana in January 2023.

2b82b2af-4ab1-4fa8-a8d6-b3fe54b34d32,Judge Slams Fani Willis for Casting 'Racial Aspersions' Toward Defendant,"Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee admonished Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis for casting “racial aspersions” toward co-defendant Mike Roman during a January speech at Big Bethel AME Church.
Roman accused Willis of financially benefiting from her affair with fellow Trump prosecutor and ex-lover Nathan Wade. McAfee ruled Friday that Willis can stay on the case if Wade is fired.
In McAfee’s ruling, he took issue with race comments Willis made in January. While in church, Willis said she hired three prosecutors, one of whom is black, referencing Wade. She further stated that the accusations against her and Wade were leveled because political opponents were using the “race card.”
“First thing they say, ‘Oh, she can play the race card now.’ But no, God, isn’t it them?” Willis asked behind the church pulpit.
“Who’s playing the race card when they only question one [Wade]? Isn’t [it] them playing the race card?” she asked. “I’ve been doing almost 30 years [sic].”
McAfee said Willis’s comments “cast racial aspersions at an indicted Defendant’s decision to file this pretrial motion”:
More at issue, instead of attributing the criticism to a criminal accused’s general aversion to being convicted and facing a prison sentence, the District Attorney ascribed the effort as motivated by “playing the race card.” She went on to frequently refer to SADA Wade as the “black man” while her other unchallenged SADAs were labeled “one white woman” and “one white man.” The effect of this speech was to cast racial aspersions at an indicted Defendant’s decision to file this pretrial motion.
Willis’s comments came after a court filing by Roman, a political operative and co-defendant of Trump in the Georgia election case, who alleged four explosive facts about Willis’s conduct while prosecuting Trump:
Nathan Wade, Willis’s lead prosecutor in the Trump case, had an “improper” relationship with Willis. Wade’s law firm used funds paid by the county to take Willis on luxury vacations by using potentially fraudulent payments. Wade was appointed without the required approval by authorities and had little to no prosecutorial experience. Wade met twice with President Joe Biden’s White House counsel before indicting Trump in August, calling into question if the White House coordinated prosecuting Biden’s 2024 political opponent.
Willis described being the target of a ""swatting"" attack on Christmas night, when someone reported that a woman had been shot dead at her home. It led her to think that her oldest child had been shot, she said.

a3c4e70c-8168-4c89-ae83-0a1646ce4740,NSA Jake Sullivan says White House has ‘reason to believe’ one U.S. hostage will be released today,"National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said in an interview on NBC News' ""Meet the Press"" that the Biden administration has “reason to believe” one American hostage will be released on Sunday, the third day of a temporary cease-fire between Israel and Hamas.
Asked by host Kristen Welker this morning if he expects American hostages to be released today, Sullivan said: “The initial hostage deal involves the release of women and children and there are three Americans in that category: two women and one young child. And we have reason to believe that one of those Americans will be released today.""
“But until we see her out — safely from Gaza, in the hands of the authorities and ultimately in the hands of her family — then we won’t be certain,” he added. “But we have reason to believe that there will be one release today.”
A second U.S. official also told NBC News the White House has “reason to believe” an American is expected to be among those released Sunday.
On Saturday, 13 Israelis and four Thai citizens were released from Gaza as part of a deal that has seen delays, bringing the total to 26 Israelis freed from Gaza. As part of the agreement, 39 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel were also released on the second day of the truce.
In total, 50 of an estimated 240 people taken by militants in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and 150 Palestinians held by Israel are expected to be released by the end of the cease-fire Monday.
Sullivan said the U.S. is “hopeful” that more Americans will be released in the coming days.
“We think it’s long past time,” Sullivan said, adding that one of the hostages, Abigail Mor Idan, an American girl who turned four in captivity, “tragically lost her parents” in the war."

It was Chicago's highest scoring game of the season. The last-place Blackhawks improved to 3-13-3 in their last 19 games, including a 5-2 win at the Coyotes on Tuesday.
Blackwell, a checking and energy forward, relished the accomplishment that boosted his goal total to eight in 35 games. The 30-year-old journeyman returned to the lineup in December after a tough recovery from sports hernia surgery about a year ago.
""It's come a long way in the past 12 months or so here,"" Blackwell said. ""So to be able to get the hat trick, it was great.""
Blackwell completed his hat trick with an empty-netter with 2:36 left. He tried to set up Bedard for the rookie's first three-goal game on a 2-on-1 midway through the third period, but Bedard fired wide.
""Unfortunately, it slid off, but it was a nice play by Blackie,"" he said. ""But it ended up working out with him to be able to get (the hat trick).""
Bedard leads NHL rookies with 19 goals and 46 points in 51 games. The 18-year-old center had no goals and four assists in his previous eight games.
The No. 1 overall pick in last year's NHL draft attempted 15 shots during Saturday night's 4-1 loss at Washington, but only four were on net.
Seth Jones had a career-high four assists for Chicago, and Ryan Donato had a goal and an assist. Tyler Johnson also scored.
Clayton Keller had two goals for Arizona, running his team-best total to 25 on the season. Nick Schmaltz had a goal and two assists against his first NHL team, and Dylan Guenther also scored.
The Coyotes surrendered four power-play goals in their previous loss to the Blackhawks, and then allowed two more on Sunday.
""I think our execution was off,"" Arizona coach Andre Tourigny said. ""We played solid in the first, but then I don't think we played as hard in the second. We were outside of our structure in every aspect defensively.""
Arvid Soderblom made 32 saves for Chicago. Connor Ingram stopped 34 shots for Arizona.
Keller opened the scoring during a 4-on-4 stretch 6:09 into the first period. He beat a screened Soderblom high on the stick side.
Keller made it 2-0 just 11 seconds into the second. He sped behind the Blackhawks' defense, took Schmaltz's feed and slid a low shot past Soderblom's stick side.
Bedard cut it to 2-1 at 5:28 when his centering pass from behind the net deflected in off Arizona defenseman J.J.Moser.
""That was nice to see that one go in,"" Bedard said. ""I don't know how or who it went off.""
That got Chicago rolling. Blackwell tied it at 2 at 6:57, popping in a rebound of Alex Vlasic's shot from the point.
Bedard put Chicago ahead during a 5-on-3 power play at 10:05. He danced into the slot from the right circle and snapped a shot past Ingram.
Guenther tied it on a rebound with 6:04 left in the second.
Set up by Bedard's diagonal feed across the slot, Johnson ripped in a one-timer from the left side of the net with 2:10 left in the period to put Chicago back in front.
Blackwell swatted in his second goal from the crease 33 seconds into the third. Schmaltz ripped in a rebound at 6:49 to complete a flurry.
Donato poked the puck free, then moved in to make it 6-4 at 8:00.
Blackhawks forward Andreas Athanasiou, out since Nov. 9 with a groin/hip injury, skated before the game and likely will return this week, coach Luke Richardson said.

David Bouley, one of America’s most innovative chefs, has died of a heart attack at the ago of 70 at his home in Kent, Connecticut.
Known for his exacting standards in the kitchen and a restless drive to create, Bouley was emblematic of the highly independent chef of the New American Cuisine that changed the world’s perception of our nation’s food around the world.
His focus on using the best, sometimes exotic, ingredients combined with classic French culinary technique—he had dual French citizenship—became a hallmark of the best of his colleagues’ work in the 1990s and afterwards. In 2020, the French Government bestowed upon him the title of Knight in the Order of the agricultural Merit for outstanding contributions to food and agriculture. And for his lifelong mission to make food that was healthy and to spread the doctrine of good nutrition, Bouley garnered Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Celiac Disease Center at Columbia University and the Rogosin Institute, an affiliate of New York-Presbyterian.
Born in Storrs, Connecticut, on May 27, 1953, he spent summers milking cows and making butter at his French grandparents’ Rhode Island farm, which gave him a lifelong connection to the land from which his ingredients came. After attending the University of Connecticut at Storrs, he took jobs in restaurants in Cape Cod and Santa Fe, then went to France to study the Cours de Civilisation Française at the Sorbonne in Paris. There he discovered his interest in food and culture and was soon traveling the traditional road of young cooks to join the kitchen brigades of restaurants in France, which included the renowned Moulins de Mougins in Cannes. Paul Bocuse in Lyon and Auberge de’L’ill in Illhaeusern. Next stop was New York at some of the city’s finest French restaurants like Le Cirque and La Côte Basque.
In 1985 restaurateur Drew Nieporent opened Montrachet in a dreary stretch of TriBeCa that helped galvanize the neighborhood, hiring Bouley as chef. Quickly they quickly acquired a New York Times rave review, praising innovative dishes like smoked eggplant and roasted red pepper terrine, roast duck with wild mushrooms, leeks and pearl onions in a red wine sauce tinged with cinnamon and smoked salmon in a mousseline with sevruga caviar. By then, however, Bouley’s sense of perfectionism sometimes meant long waits between courses, causing titanic battles between him and Nieporent, with Bouley exiting to open his own namesake restaurant nearby in 1987.
From then on, Bouley got nothing but raves from every quarter, including Michelin stars and six James Beard Foundation awards. Bouley was a very beautiful restaurant, softly lighted with votive candles and smelling of ripe apples piled in baskets in the foyer. Still, the long wait times persisted as he lingered over a cook’s dish and, if it was not perfect, throw it in the waste can and tell the cook to start it all over again. Once, when I dined there with Ella Brennan, owner of Commander’s Palace in New Orleans and her new young chef Emeril Lagasse, the wait between courses—and there were a dozen of them—could be a half hour, causing a still hungry Lagasse to remark, “Do you think we could send out for pizza while we wait?”
By then Bouley had become a celebrity, even named one of People Magazine’s “50 Most Beautiful People” in the world in 1994. After becoming obsessed with breadmaking, in 1997 he relocated Bouley as Bouley Bakery, which he used on 9/11 as a base to feed rescuers at Ground Zero. Then, in 1999 he opened an idiosyncratic Austrian restaurant named Danube, authoring East of Paris: The New Cuisines of Austria and the Danube.
By the turn of the century he was still in the vanguard of modern cuisine but sometimes difficult to locate. Where Danube had been, he opened Brushstroke in concert with the Tsuji Culinary Institute in Osaka. Next came a lecture series and dinners for healthy food called The Chef & The Doctor. Then there was Bouley Test Kitchen as a private event space and learning center for visiting guest chefs, while he began developing products for Bouley enterprises, including Bouley at Home, which closed when the pandemic hit.
His imagination was feverish, his ferreting out of new, healthful ingredients his guiding light, as his cooking became less rich than the butter-and-cream cuisine he’d learned in France and which he’d turned into tasting menus, which in France would have been six or seven course; at Bouley it was twelve, paving the way for other chefs worldwide to increase it to 18 or even, in the case of Spanish innovator Ferran Adrià at El Bulli, up to 50.
“I reviewed David and his brilliant team three times in as many locations (all four stars),” says former Times critic Brian Miller. “His restaurants always carried the aroma of astonishing intelligence and endless innovation. What a historic loss to our profession.”
Not many chefs deserve historic status, and fewer still might be called icons. But in the case of David Bouley his name will join the great ones—including some his illustrious French mentors—who helped define the best and most influential of their era.
He is survived by his wife Nicole Barthelme and five siblings."

Karolina Shiino's nomination in January first sparked debate after some right-wingers questioned the title being awarded to a naturalized Japanese citizen. A scandal then erupted over her private life when weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun reported on her extra-marital relationship - taboo for beauty pageant contestants, who are held to squeaky-clean moral standards in Japan.
Japanese entertainment personalities who have affairs, dabble in drugs or suffer other scandals also often find themselves shunned by their fans and employers.
The Miss Japan Association said Monday that it had accepted a request from Shiino to return the crown for ""personal reasons,"" adding there would be no Miss Japan for 2024.

Shiino, who emigrated to Japan at the age of five, said she wanted to ""deeply apologize"" to those involved, including the man's wife, on the same day her management agency said she had confirmed the affair.
At first ""I couldn't speak the truth due to chaos and fear... I apologize to those who believed in me and supported me,"" the 26-year-old said on Instagram. ""I take the situation seriously and have relinquished the Miss Japan Grand Prix title.""
In a statement Monday, Shiino's agency said she told them she had begun seeing the man believing him to be divorced, but continued the relationship after learning he was still married.
The man involved, Takuma Maeda, is a social media influencer known online as the ""muscle doctor,"" who, according to The Associated Press, said on Instagram that he had no plans to leave his wife and offered an apology the trouble he'd brought Shiino and others. He promised to devote himself to his work, and his private life.
Women are often more heavily criticized over extramarital affairs in Japan's deeply conservative, male-dominated culture.
Miss Japan, first held in 1950, is awarded for ""Japanese-style beauty"" consisting of ""inner beauty, beauty in appearance and beauty of actions,"" its website says.
After Shiino's nomination attracted attention online, people quickly weighed in on social media.
""It doesn't matter if she is Jewish-Ukrainian or not, but I can't accept her character... Why is she Miss Japan?"" one user wrote.
Others wrote in support of Shiino on her Instagram post, however.
""You have Japanese spirit. I don't think such (a) personal private thing should be a reason for you to step down but this is Japan,"" said a reply with nearly 350 likes."

Protecting valuable intellectual property from rival organizations is critical. In today’s economy, it’s not uncommon to see workers move relatively frequently from one job and company to another—particularly in the tech industry. As employees transition between roles and companies, the risk of IP theft looms large. Additionally, if a departing employee has played a large role in building or maintaining critical systems, it’s important to ensure vital knowledge isn’t lost when they’re gone.
Effectively guarding and keeping valuable IP requires a multifaceted approach. Below, 20 members of Forbes Technology Council share strategies that tech companies can implement to safeguard their IP in the face of a mobile workforce. Follow their recommendations to ensure your company’s proprietary knowledge and data stay in the right hands.
1. Prioritize Integrity When Hiring
IP protection begins with selective hiring that prioritizes personal integrity alongside technical talent. As a team member onboards, ensure they understand that safeguarding IP is their personal responsibility, as well as what that means in terms of their behavior and communication. What elements of their work cannot be discussed in public? How are they to handle their devices? Prepare your team by teaching them safe habits. - HK Bain, Digitech Systems, LLC
2. Ensure New Employees Sign NDAs
Companies should ensure that employees sign a bond and nondisclosure agreement at the point of hire. The company’s confidential documents should be in a passworded repository, and access should be granted only to authorized users. The intellectual property of a company should not be easily accessible by other companies; therefore, companies should ensure adequate security is enforced. - Nihinlola Adeyemi, ErrandPay Limited
Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify?
3. Build A Culture Of Trust
First and foremost, companies need to build a culture of trust with employees. Recognize that most employees will move on over time and, as much as possible, should leave on good terms. Trust, verification and good, transparent cyber practices—including not allowing USB devices, monitoring outbound information and unusual data transfers—are great steps. Communicate with your employees. - Michael Adler, N-able
4. Create And Enforce Policies Outlining Data Usage
Roughly 12% of employees take sensitive IP with them when they leave an organization. Security leaders must create, communicate and enforce policies that define the acceptable use of corporate data, devices and networks. Implementing a zero-trust mindset, removing data access for departing employees and adopting tools that deliver a full audit trail can also stop data loss from occurring. - Mohan Koo, DTEX Systems
5. Lead By Example
Leading by example goes a long way, and showing your own high integrity when a new employee joins sets the stage. At induction, all hires from our competitors are told we only want to leverage their experience and subject matter expertise. They are advised not to exploit any source code, business logic or insider secrets from their past employer at any cost. We live that way; it works! - Pramod Konandur Prabhakar, Pelatro PLC
6. Focus On Retention
Retention is the best way to protect your IP. Keeping employees happy should be priority No. 1 for any organization. When attrition does happen, it’s your job to offboard your employees with the same diligence that you onboarded them. Dedicated sessions for the employee on what constitutes company IP (and their liability) are important to ensure all the important information is being shared. - Lewis Wynne-Jones, ThinkData Works
7. Utilize IGA Solutions
To protect their intellectual property, organizations need identity governance and administration capabilities. IGA allows an organization to understand and control who can access a given resource and what they can do with it. The best IGA solutions will deploy artificial intelligence to find access anomalies, track access behaviors and flag risks—such as downloading the full contents of a drive to a new device. - Jim Taylor, RSA Security
8. Map Business Processes Using UPN Standards
How a business operates and how its systems are configured to support business processes are critical factors of IP. If this is in people’s heads, when they leave, it is lost forever. This is easily resolved. Ensure that business processes are mapped using Universal Process Notation standards. Build a metadata dictionary to document all the configurations. We call this “change intelligence.” - Ian Gotts, Elements.cloud
9. Don’t Rest On Your Laurels
Keep innovating! Today’s shiny new thing is tomorrow’s legacy software. Build a strong culture of continuous innovation, and you will be better both at retaining staff and at relegating anything that does escape to the legacy backburner. - Anthony Brooke, DrFirst, Inc.
10. Focus On Shared IP Ecosystems
Focus on open innovation and shared IP ecosystems. By collaborating with universities, startups and competitors on specific projects, tech companies can benefit from wider expertise. Patenting only core innovations incentivizes sharing peripheral knowledge, making it harder for employees or others to replicate. This fosters a culture of transparency where innovation thrives beyond individual ownership. - Shelli Brunswick, SB Global LLC
11. Lock Down Access To Important Files
It’s vital to lock down access to important files and directories after an employee departs your company. It’s easy to forget this important step, but it’s essential for tech teams to lead by example when it comes to information security. - Syed Ahmed, Act-On Software
12. Automate Onboarding And Offboarding Processes
Invest in cybersecurity tools, such as employee onboarding and offboarding solutions. Automated user onboarding and offboarding processes will reduce the risk of forgetting to “offboard” employees who do not work for your company anymore, thus securing access to company resources. Also, make sure to protect your company with data loss prevention tools. - Juta Gurinaviciute, NordLayer
13. Ensure All Work Is Created On Company-Managed Systems
Companies should focus on retaining their employees first. Further, organizations should ensure that employees’ work is created on systems that are company-managed and protected and that any unlawful or out-of-the-ordinary accessing of the company’s technical assets flags an investigation to determine whether someone is attempting to pilfer company assets. - Russ Kennedy, Nasuni
14. Leverage Behavioral Analytics
In a high-turnover environment, use advanced behavioral analytics to identify patterns that might indicate potential IP threats from departing employees. Examples to look for are massive data downloads and forwarding emails to noncorporate email addresses. By correlating employee behavior data with project access logs, tech companies can preemptively secure IP before it’s at risk. - Rob Tillman, Copy Chief©
15. Limit Access To Sensitive IP
Require robust nondisclosure and noncompete agreements. Limit access to sensitive IP to only what the individual needs to know, and implement strict data classification policies. Log access and regularly audit systems. Provide ongoing training on handling confidential data properly, and have your legal team review third party contracts. Building an ethical culture that values IP protection is also key. - Sachin Parate, Twilio Inc.
16. Take A Holistic Approach
Implement robust exit procedures, including thorough knowledge-transfer sessions and nondisclosure agreements, to safeguard proprietary information when employees depart. Regularly update and reinforce confidentiality policies to maintain awareness among current staff. Utilize advanced access controls and monitoring systems to track and restrict sensitive data access. - Favour Femi-Oyewole, Access Bank PLC
17. Help Employees Feel Invested In The Company’s Success
Foster a culture of trust and loyalty by recognizing and rewarding employees for their contributions. Promote an environment where employees feel invested in the success of the company, reducing the likelihood of IP breaches. - Meiran Galis, Scytale
18. Limit Employees’ Work
Leveraging invasive solutions such as digital rights management or mobile device management is usually a bad practice. It’s helpful to have a tool that can remotely wipe IP from a departed employee’s PC; however, getting an existing employee to agree to install it can be trust-breaking. NDA training is only helpful in countries where one can sue. One proven solution that works is to limit what employees work on and never have them work with production data. - Boris Lapouga, WorkHQ
19. Require Regular Compliance Training
The major threat to any intellectual property is a lack of awareness of the dangers. To combat this, you should regularly offer IP awareness and compliance training that educates employees on their role in protecting IP and the legal and ethical implications of mishandling it. - Gergo Vari, Lensa, Inc.
20. Keep An Eye Out For Leaked Information
Tech companies should have clear rules about keeping company data, even after someone leaves. They should also make sure to cut off access to company systems and keep an eye out for any leaked information online. - Margarita Simonova, ILoveMyQA"

Chicago mayor says city is almost at capacity as more migrants dropped off in suburbs
CHICAGO (CBS) – Mayor Brandon Johnson said the City of Chicago is almost at capacity with migrants, even as more asylum seekers were making their way to the suburbs and other towns and villages in the area.
As of Wednesday, Chicago has received more than 26,000 asylum seekers. At least 10 buses of additional migrants were expected to arrive on Wednesday. Chicago's Office of Emergency Management and Communications (OEMC) said at least three buses arrived in the suburbs on Tuesday.
Some local leaders met with Johnson about what to do. Johnson also met with the mayors of Denver and New York to talk about what happens next. CBS 2's Sabrina Franza had the story.
""Without significant intervention from the federal government, this mission will not be sustained,"" Johnson said Wednesday.
Even as the city is nearing capacity, migrants continue to make their way via buses onto Metra trains and into the city. Chicago counted at least 19 buses, that officials know of. CBS 2 called around and asked local suburban communities how many asylum seekers they've received.
Buses have stopped as far as Kankakee, about 50 miles south of Chicago. Other communities like Fox River Grove, Elmhurst, Aurora, Naperville, Lockport, and University Park also reported receiving buses. By CBS 2's tally, there have been at least 28 buses that have dropped migrants off in suburban communities.
""We've received migrants in the middle of the night with little to no coordination,"" Johnson said.
Johnson met virtually Wednesday with Denver Mayor Mike Johnston and New York Mayor Eric Adams to discuss their joint efforts to secure more federal funding to care for migrants.
""We also need better coordination at the border,"" said Johnson.
Chicago's mayor also met with leaders in other Illinois suburbs to connect with those who are receiving migrants they were not expecting. He said buses were ""literally dropping families off in the middle of nowhere.""
""I don't think anyone was prepared for the enormity,"" said Elizabeth Scott, the village manager of south suburban University Park.
Scott reported that at least 15 buses have stopped in her village since Friday. About 130 families decided to stay in University Park.
""We're trying to absorb as many as we can, however being a small community, we just don't have all the resources that we need,"" she said.
One bus actually dropped people off in the middle of a cornfield.
""They're walking down the street,"" Scott said. ""Toddlers with no coats.""
Even though the city anticipated about 10 buses arriving on Wednesday, no one know where they'll stop.
""By the time we get word, it's really us at that point trying to be reactive instead of proactive,"" Scott said."

Most people have something they fear, even if that fear isn't so marked or out of proportion to actual danger to be considered a phobia. And it may not cause clinically significant distress or impairment that interferes with our daily functioning, as a phobia would do. And yet, it might make us anxious about certain objects and situations we would prefer not to be worried about.
Through my personal experience working with business leaders, I've learned that some of their most common fears include responsibility, taking risks, making decisions, making mistakes, and failing or disappointing others. When we deeply care about something, as leaders care about their businesses, a certain level of worry is expected and quite normal. But fear that paralyzes us and interferes with our ability to lead successfully is not.
Psychological Interventions To Leave Your Fears Behind
Regardless of what you might fear, there are well-established interventions you can use to leave your fears behind. Let’s take systematic desensitization (also called graduated exposure therapy) as an example. Wolpe, a South African psychiatrist and behavioral psychotherapist, developed systematic desensitization over 70 years ago while trying to figure out how to treat post-traumatic stress disorder in World War II veterans. Despite being developed many years ago, systematic desensitization is still considered the gold standard for working with phobias and anxiety disorders of various kinds.
Now, although this intervention is drawn from behavioral psychology, and although I often use it in formal psychotherapy and coaching sessions, people can and do use variations of this approach to confront their fears outside of psychotherapy and coaching. There is no magic to it. Below, I'll explain each step of Wolpe's method as well as how you can adapt it to work on your own business-related fears.
Desensitization In Five Steps
1. Understand
The first step is becoming familiar with the theoretical rationale behind desensitization. Basically, people cannot be tense and relaxed at the same time. It’s called mutual inhibition—you can be either tense or relaxed, not both. Thus, if you learn to remain relaxed as you face the feared situation, you will no longer be tense. But how do you learn to do this?
2. Relax
In the second step, you teach yourself relaxation techniques. My personal preference is progressive muscle relaxation, but other methods work equally well, including breathwork and meditation. Some also like the 5-4-3-2-1 method (""find five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell and one thing you can taste""). Note that the progressive muscle relaxation technique is not indicated for those with a history of back issues, muscle spasms or serious injuries.
3. Identify
Now that we have introduced some tools that may help you relax, we proceed to the third step: identifying the fear hierarchy. In this step, you make a list of situations that trigger your fear. Then you line them up, in order. from small thrills to big scares. Sometimes, there is only a single situation one fears. In that case, line up the scary moments in this situation, from smaller to bigger.
For instance, imagine a leader who fears decision-making. He is currently avoiding making any decisions, and his business is seriously suffering. This leader would list the specific decisions he fears and, consequently, avoids. The list might include deciding which cleaning company to hire for his building, deciding whether to hire/fire a particular (prospective) manager, deciding whether to expand his business to a new market, deciding whether to sign an important contract, etc.
Clearly, not all these decisions are equally frightening. As he and his partners really appreciate tidiness, he is afraid of hiring a cleaning company that would do sloppy work. Yet this is a minor decision compared to decisions like whether to expand his business, and would probably be assigned the lowest ranking in the hierarchy. On the other hand, a decision about hiring, expanding the business or signing a high-level contract would likely get the highest rank.
4. Exposure
The fourth step involves exposure. In this step, you go through your list of scares, imagining each one in detail, and practice keeping your body relaxed while being exposed to what you fear. You start with the least scary ones, and move from there. In the example above, our business leader would first practice staying relaxed while imagining deciding on the cleaning service. Importantly, you only proceed to the higher fear-inducing levels once you have managed to remain relaxed during the lower ones.
5. Repetition
The fifth and final step is consolidating the lessons learned through repeating this process.
Final Thoughts
Although this article mainly focuses on business leaders and their fears, a similar approach can be used for very different workplace scenarios and by people holding very different positions within the corporate world—managers who fear public speaking, employees who fear saying no to management, etc.
There is no doubt that systematic desensitization works. It has worked for me, the people I work with and some people who have tried it on their own. The emphasis here, though, is on ""some."" I do want to note that systematic desensitization is usually done with a therapist, and a therapist’s support might be particularly valuable during exposure (the fourth step).
However, some people successfully use this method without professional assistance. Thus, I encourage you to try it on your own and follow your own internal cues. If you find that even exposure to the most benign scares is too overwhelming, I advise you not to torture yourself but to seek professional help. Psychotherapists and coaches are trained in these interventions and can help you along the way.

Carter had a longstanding career in the entertainment industry and was best known for his roles as Sgt. Joe Broadhurst on the television series, “McCloud,” as well as Colonel Tigh, on the original version of “Battlestar Galactica.” The famous actor’s death was confirmed on his official website, which also boasted a tribute in his honor. His son, Miguel Carter DeCoste also addressed his passing in a statement issued to The New York Times. His cause of death has not been shared.
Carter was an Emmy-nominated producer who was recognized as one of the first Black actors to regularly appear on a television sitcom. He appeared in 92 episodes of “The Phil Silvers Show,” in the role of Private Sugarman, from 1955-1959,. according to People.
Two years later, he appeared in “Parrish,” a film adaptation of the Mildred Savage novel. He went on to portray the only Black G.I. in the World War II series “Combat!” The talented star became New England’s first Black TV anchor on WBZ-TV “Eyewitness News” in Boston while balancing his “Combat!” role, according to People. He went on to become the drama and movie critic for the station.
In addition to his acting credits, Carter launched his own production company in 1975.

7072b1a9-ebe5-4d77-9d0e-72d4b6b8ce58,"How the 'Barbie,' 'Oppenheimer' double feature blew up","This weekend, it’s a battle of the bombshells at the summer box office.
Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” finally land in theaters Friday, after more than a year of online memes that have playfully pitted the films against each other. The star-studded projects couldn’t be more different: one is a sweetly subversive comedy starring Margot Robbie as the iconic doll, while the other is a cerebral, three-hour drama about the making of the atomic bomb.
And yet, the two films have become an unlikely double feature, with AMC reporting that 40,000 of its movie club members have already purchased tickets to see both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” on the same day.
“I think it’s the perfect double bill,” says Robbie, speaking to USA TODAY before the Screen Actors Guild strike. “It’s like having a steak dinner, then an ice cream sundae for dessert. I want both!”
The 'Barbenheimer' movie meme has blown up in 'unprecedented' ways
The “Barbenheimer” meme was born early last year when it was announced that Warner Bros.' “Barbie” would be released in theaters the same day as Universal Pictures’ “Oppenheimer.” Twitter instantly latched onto the dichotomy of the two films, cracking jokes about the light and dark nature of the respective movies, and their tongue-in-cheek battle for the soul of America.
But the internet running gag has become a real-world sensation in recent weeks. Hundreds of handmade “Barbenheimer” T-shirts have flooded retail sites such as Etsy and Redbubble. Fan-made posters crop up daily on social media, garnering hundreds of thousands of “likes"" for their eye-popping mashups. Opening-day screenings of both films have already sold out at theater chains including AMC and Alamo Drafthouse, while some independent cinemas around the country are offering movie-themed menus and “Barbenheimer” costume parties.
“I can think of times in my life when there's been excitement about a new movie coming, but I'm not sure that we were seeing anything quite like this. It's a bit unprecedented,” says Michael O’Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. “Everybody's rallying around this weekend as a major event, and I think it won't just be this weekend. These movies are going to have a long life in the theater.”
The fervor is reminiscent of last summer’s #GentleMinions TikTok trend, in which teens flocked to “Minions: The Rise of Gru” wearing suits and ties. Videos of kids’ awestruck reactions to the live-action “The Little Mermaid” trailer, and dressing in costume to go see the film, similarly made a splash online.
But “ ‘Barbenheimer’ has gotten way more attention than any such meme in recent memory,” says Emma Ferrara, chief business development officer at marketing agency Viral Nation. “It highlights the power of social media marketing: You have two movies that would normally compete for audience attention, but thanks to a viral meme uniting the two, both films may now see higher box-office totals than previously expected.”
Margot Robbie:The star never thought she'd have 'empathy for a doll.' Then she made 'Barbie.'
The 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' casts are 'so supportive' of each other
Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at Box Office Pro, predicts that “Barbie” will win the weekend with $115 million – but “it could go higher, maybe even significantly so,” he says. Meanwhile, “Oppenheimer,” once expected to debut with $40 million, could now crack $50 million to $60 million.
""It's enhanced because of 'Barbenheimer,' which is something unpredictable and unforeseen, but a great thing for both movies,"" Robbins says. ""It has turned into this counterprogramming powerhouse. They've really met in the middle to form this odd, crazy, weird phenomenon.""
The filmmakers and stars of both projects have embraced the grassroots campaign, with Robbie and “Barbie” director Greta Gerwig posing for a picture holding “Oppenheimer” tickets.
“I feel very shiny to be associated with that (movie). It’s really fun,” Gerwig told USA TODAY last month. “Please, go to both! A rising tide lifts all boats.”
Emily Blunt, who stars in “Oppenheimer,” similarly shares the love for Team “Barbie.”
“They’ve been so supportive toward us, and that’s what it’s all about,” Blunt said in a pre-strike interview with USA TODAY. “It doesn’t have to be competitive! It’s really cool and that’s what we want: that full spectrum of what you can see in movie theaters. We love it.”

It happened in the afternoon on Saturday, Jan. 6 at Century Bowling.
It was supposed to be a fun night where the Easterseals MORC Miracle Bowling League gathered for its first bowling night as a league. Susie Glasgow, of Easterseals, said a man took off with over $300 in cash and a check for $210.
""Unfortunately, we had a bad apple that decided he was going to take our money bag with cash and checks in it from behind the registration table,"" said Glasgow. ""For somebody to take away money that provides programs like baseball and bowling for these kids with special needs it was just heartbreaking to me.""
But all was not lost thanks to the generosity of others. Glasgow said since then, the donations have been pouring in. She said so far, the Daisy project has raised over $600, and Century Bowling donated $1000 to the league so they can continue their good work.
The man they believe took the money was caught on surveillance camera. People are asked to contact Waterford Township police if they have any information.
Glasgow said if you would like to donate to their bowling league to benefit kids with special needs, you can email her at Sglasgow@eastersealsmorc.org."

But the evening got off on a high note -- a few of them, actually -- thanks to a visit to the B's locker room by superstar Celine Dion.
The five-time Grammy Award winner and her two sons made an appearance in the Bruins dressing room ahead of the game, as Dion was welcomed in to read off Boston's starting lineup. Bruins head coach and fellow Quebec native Jim Montgomery introduced Dion, who used her golden pipes to get through Boston's starting six.
As you can see from the video shared by the Bruins, Dion really got into her introductions:
She got a nice round of chuckles when she thanked a barely clothed Brandon Carlo for ""getting ready for me tonight,"" and then hit a high note when she read forward Danton Heinen's name. Bruins players loved having the ""Queen of Power Ballads"" on hand Thursday night, since Montgomery usually just rattles off the starting lineup before games.
Dion's rendition was obviously much better and much more entertaining. And considering she's from Quebec, seeing Dion enjoying some time with the Bruins is probably driving fans of the Montreal Canadiens absolutely bonkers.
Dion and her sons stuck around to watch Thursday's game in Boston, and she was eventually named the Fan of the Game late in the third period. Unfortunately, the Dion crew didn't see the best of effort out of the Bruins, as Boston lost 5-2 to the Rangers."

a1d970cb-b7e6-4f81-9701-52fd92ccc43e,"Tedious, pointless, cringe-inducing: why The Idol was a failure from start to finish","The Idol, the Weeknd and Sam Levinson’s embattled, controversial, woefully received erotic thriller, wrapped up after five weeks last night – not with a bang, nor a whimper, but a profound: huh? What was this show about, if anything? Nothing happened: the plot points covered in this show could make about two tight hours’ worth of television – or one probably-quite-watchable film – and instead were stretched to five, each episode padded out with extended musical numbers, montages of a sun-drenched Los Angeles, and some mightily cringe-inducing sex scenes.
In its final hour, the show was nothing if not consistent. By my count, about half the episode’s run-time was taken up with an extended showcase in which five characters – Moses Sumney’s Izaak; Troye Sivan’s Xander; Suzanna Son’s Chloe; Ramsey, playing herself; and, of course, Lily-Rose Depp’s Jocelyn – all performed entire solo musical numbers. (It was, at the very least, funny to watch Sumney and Depp grind on a bunch of bewildered label reps in what I have to assume was one of the show’s many improvised scenes.) The show’s main mystery – who, exactly, is Tedros, the mysterious would-be svengali played by the Weeknd? – is wrapped up in a single scene, in which music execs played by Hank Azaria, Jane Adams and Eli Roth laugh cartoonishly as they recount his history as a pimp, a sordid past dredged up by Vanity Fair reporter Talia (Hari Nef) in, apparently, less than a week.
It doesn’t need to be said that this is not the TV show we were promised. It’s not – following HBO going in “a new creative direction” – a provocative thriller directed by brilliant indie film-maker Amy Seimetz that features Showgirls’ Elizabeth Berkley and the final on-screen performance of the late Anne Heche. It’s also not the merry-go-round of gratuitous torture porn that crew members alleged the Weeknd and Levinson turned it into in a January Rolling Stone report. Instead, The Idol was curiously normal: not high art; no more morally objectionable than many other self-consciously transgressive TV shows. Occasionally, it was great as a so-bad-it’s-good watch, but more often it was just kind of boring.

There were flashes of brilliance among the shots of Depp sullenly smoking by the pool. The scenes of music-industry satire, in which withered executives drooled over gratuitous nudity, mental illness and scandal, rang fundamentally true, if a little cartoonish. The gag built into this episode’s musical showcase – which began with Roth’s and Adams’ characters about to write off Jocelyn and her band of weirdo stragglers, only for them to change their tune once they each received lapdances – was a little on-the-nose, but it was pretty funny, and, unfortunately, indicative of the way major label reps see dollar signs in their eyes the moment any performance becomes slutty and orgiastic.
Other industry-related plotlines didn’t quite click in the same way. Jocelyn’s backing dancer Dyanne, played by Blackpink’s Jennie, was being groomed by a music executive to cut a song originally intended for Jocelyn, with Levinson clearly attempting to wring tension from the idea that the pair would eventually come to loggerheads. Dyanne’s screen time was so minimal, though, that this never amounted to anything: Jocelyn won back the love of her label, and Dyanne was thrown into the industry meatgrinder. It’s kind of a fun joke, but it would have had far more resonance had the show been more driven by plot or character interaction than by pure vibe.
As The Idol wound to a close, it became evident that this wasn’t even the show that its cast and lead crew initially thought they were making. Dan Levy, originally part of the supporting cast and featured heavily in trailers, ended up appearing only in the first episode, making what amounted to a cameo. When I spoke to cast member Da’Vine Joy Randolph before it aired, she promised that the show’s status quo would shift dramatically as the season progressed; it didn’t really, unless you put a lot of stock in the final scenes, in which it’s implied that Jocelyn was the one pulling the strings the whole time. I don’t really buy that, simply because, for the bulk of the series, what you saw was what you got: some violent sex, some funny sex, a few immortal Rachel Sennott reaction shots, and very little in the way of genuine interiority for either Jocelyn or Tedros.
Had the show been longer, it might have been better able to sow its seeds, and the payoff would have been more satisfying. But it seems that Levinson might have struggled even more with a longer series, given the fact that the show was cut down from a planned six episodes to five. (I’m hoping that, somewhere down the line, we get to see the Seimetz-directed version of the show, which was shot then canned. Even in an incomplete form, it could hardly be worse than what we ended up with.)

I have no doubt that The Idol will be ripe for cringe-viewing in future. Watching over the past few weeks, it already felt a little like some kind of pulpy box-office flop rescued from the archives. And I’m profoundly indebted to the show for one significant reason: it gave us World Class Sinner, a Jocelyn hit that’s meant to be bad but which I – and many of my friends – just can’t stop listening to. Unlike much of The Idol, World Class Sinner is camp, ridiculous fun – a send-up of dumb pop music that still has all the shiver-inducing thrills of the real thing. If only The Idol had been half as good."

""It's poetic, right? It's almost in the air,"" said Demko, who also took part in a ceremonial faceoff with Sergei Bobrovsky, his Florida counterpart.
Demko had his third shutout of the season and sixth in the NHL. Dakota Joshua scored twice, Brock Boeser had his 22nd and Andrei Kuzmenko added a goal. Vancouver improved to 20-9-1, going 4-1-0 on a five-game homestand.
""We're still trying to establish our identity,"" Vancouver coach Rick Tocchet said ""We're chipping away at it and trying to be a hard team to play against, being smart in our own endWe're still learning. There's still some times when we're giving the puck away when we shouldn't, but I think that's part of the maturation to get to the next level.""
Bobrovsky made 13 saves for Florida in the first two periods, and Anthony Stolarz stopped the lone shot he faced in the third. The Panthers dropped to 17-10-2, also falling 4-0 at Seattle on Tuesday night.
""We weren't very good here tonight but in a highly unusual way and I'll take solace in that fact,"" Panthers coach Paul Maurice said. ""We have a handful of things that we do well, none of what you got to see tonight.""
Luongo, now part of Florida's front office, spent parts of eight seasons with Vancouver. He retired in 2019 and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame last year.
Fans cheered with choruses of ""Lou! Lou!"" throughout Luongo's speech and while he performed the ceremonial faceoff between Demko and Bobrovsky.

f9b21001-0f65-4685-8c07-1f8d5dbd728e,Release Date And Everything You Need To Know,"Ghost Of Tsushima Credit: Sony
There’s been a lot of talk lately in the video game industry about Xbox exclusives making their way to other platforms, and as always it’s been a very controversial subject (and one we discuss in my latest Game Night! podcast).
I’m generally sympathetic to the idea of exclusives being “timed” or having some sort of perk for their home platform (such as an Xbox game being free with Game Pass but not free on PlayStation). Exclusive games are certainly one way for a business to lock in its customer base and make money. Then again, by definition you’ll have fewer consumers if you only launch a game on one platform.
That’s been the thinking over at Microsoft for years now, where Xbox titles have been released on both console and PC concurrently. I’ve always thought this was a mistake. But Sony’s alternative—for many years only releasing its titles on PlayStation—was also a mistake.
Sony has settled on what I would call the “sweet spot” when it comes to console exclusivity: Release exclusive titles on PlayStation only and then a year or so later, release them on PC. Which leads us to Ghost Of Tsushima, a game that launched way back in 2020—and one that I believed deserved Game Of The Year over its PlayStation rival, The Last Of Us Part II.
Now, obviously more than a year has passed between then and now, but finally we’re getting Ghost Of Tsushima on PC, after it was also released on PS4 and PS5, getting a Director’s Cut in 2021 which will be the same version PC players get if they purchase the game on Steam.
Given we’ve had no real news about this upcoming PC release, it’s surprising to see how soon the game comes out, with a release date of May 16th, 2024. Not every PC release has gone smoothly for Sony, with The Last Of Us releasing in a truly shoddy state, but I’m hoping Ghost Of Tsushima is a hit. I think PC players will genuinely enjoy its unique take on open-world gameplay, beautiful graphics and Japanese setting, and the really engaging combat system. This game looked like Assassin’s Creed in Japan but ended up being something so much more (though I think Assassin’s Creed fans will also enjoy it).
The story takes place in 13th century Japan during the Mongol invasion. You play as Jin Sakai, a samurai on a desperate quest against an overwhelming foe. It’s quite fun! And if you’re watching Shogun at the moment (which is excellent) this will make for a nice game to play after that series wraps.
The PC version of the game comes with some perks such as:
Unlocked framerate and expanded graphics options.
Support for ultrawide and super ultrawide, as well as triple-monitor support.
NVIDIA DLSS 3, AMD FSR 3 and Intel XeSS support. NVIDIA Reflex and DLAA are also supported if you have a compatible GPU.
They’ve actually added Japanese lip sync to this version and since it’s better to play in Japanese with subtitles, this should be a nice touch.
You can use controller or mouse and keyboard. Haptic feedback will work as intended on a PlayStation DualSense, as will adaptive triggers.
So that’s some good news in a world filled with the other kind."

ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — The Buffalo Bills are locking up defensive tackle Ed Oliver through the 2027 season after reaching an agreement to a four-year contract extension valued up to $68 million, two people familiar with negotiations told The Associated Press on Saturday.
The people spoke to The AP on the condition of anonymity because the contract has not yet been signed. One of the people provided the value of the contract, by adding Oliver is guaranteed to make $45 million.
ESPN.com first reported the deal being reached.
The Bills selected with the ninth pick in the 2019 draft out of the University of Houston. He was entering the final year of his contract after Buffalo picked up the fifth-year option of his deal last spring.
Listed at 6-foot-1 and 287 pounds, the 25-year-old Oliver has been a full-time starter in Buffalo since his second season. He relies on his speed to penetrate the line of scrimmage and be disruptive in the backfield.
In missing three games with an ankle injury, Oliver had a career-low of 2 1/2 sacks in 13 games last season. Overall, he has 14 1/2 sacks, 30 tackles for losses and forced four fumbles in 62 career games.
The agreement begins to help solidifying the middle front of the Bills defense for the long-term future with Buffalo’s other defensive tackles’ contracts set to expire after this season.
Defensive line coach Eric Washington last week challenged Oliver to be better at anticipating plays.
“When you have the kind of talent that Ed has, you’ve got to be able to process very, very quickly ... so he can play ahead of a play as opposed to playing with the sequence of that particular play.” Washington said, while crediting Oliver for playing with more confidence.

034415da-0ac6-4611-991a-3927aadc6c1d,Latest GOP Presidential Candidate Was Commissioner For Pro-Censorship Group With Left-Leaning Ties,"Former Republican Texas Rep. Will Hurd, who announced his run for president on Thursday, was previously involved with a group that advocated for censorship and is connected to prominent left-leaning individuals.
Hurd was a commissioner on the Aspen Institute’s “Commission on Information Disorder,” a group whose final report in 2021 pushed social media platforms to censor “misinformation.” The 80-page report recommends suppression tactics such as labels, downranking, warnings, strikes, suspensions, removal and more for users that spread “mis- and disinformation.”
“Harmful misinformation posted by influential accounts should be prioritized for moderation and addressed (e.g., through labels, downranking, or removal),” the commission’s final report states. “Platforms should continue to implement transparent policies for escalating action based on repetitive spreading behaviors—from first warning to temporary suspensions to permanent suspensions. There should be a clear appeals process and platforms should consider offering pathways for reform.”
The report also discusses giving “strikes” to a category of users called “savvy spreaders.”
“Savvy spreaders of misinformation know how to navigate existing policies by couching misinformation in uncertainty (‘just asking questions’) or using attribution shields (‘people are saying’), thus avoiding responsibility for the content while helping it spread.”
Additionally, it recommends censoring links, not just accounts. “Platforms should also develop policies for addressing superspreading domains— domains that repeatedly host content with harmful misinformation that is mobilized and spreads widely in-platform. These domains should be subject to the same kinds of strikes policies, with escalating enforcement from interstitial labeling, to downranking, to suspensions (disallowing links to that domain) of varying lengths.”
The commission consisted of largely progressive commissioners including University of Washington professor and misinformation researcher Kate Starbird, Prince Harry and Katie Couric, a Daily Caller News Foundation review found.
Hurd was one of the Republicans on the commission, and he also served on a Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency (CISA) subcommittee dubbed the Protecting Critical Infrastructure from Misinformation and Disinformation Subcommittee. The subcommittee recommended to CISA in June 2022 that it should detect “informational threats,” collaborate with “non-governmental” entities to debunk “misinformation,” and expand research on it.
The DCNF previously reported that the subcommittee sought to enlist left-wing research groups and pro-censorship organizations in its attempts to clamp down on misinformation. (RELATED: Former GOP Texas Rep. Will Hurd Announces Run For President)
Additionally, the commission was completely financed with $3.2 million from Craig Newmark Philanthropies, the giving organization of the founder of Craigslist, according to the Aspen Institute’s website. Newmark endorsed Democratic candidates such as then-Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, as well as donated thousands of dollars to Democrats in the 2020 election, according to the Federal Election Commission.
Further, the DCNF previously reported that Newmark’s organization funded a study accusing conservatives of spreading “disinformation” by alleging that Big Tech companies have an anti-conservative bias. The study also justified the social media censorship of the Hunter Biden laptop story.
Hurd and the Aspen Institute did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

Red Sox outfielder Jarren Duran collided with Carrasco as the Mets pitcher was covering an unoccupied third base.
A throw from first baseman Pete Alonso to Carrasco hit off the glove of the Mets’ starter and sailed behind him, and then Duran’s movement caused him to knock over Carrasco.
The righty appeared to be shaken up for a moment and was looked at by a trainer.
Carrasco remained in the game, but he was removed after allowing 10 hits in just 2 ⅓ innings.
At the time of the double play, the Mets were trailing, 1-0, and Carrasco managed to escape the rest of the inning unscathed.

The whole sequence started after Masataka Yoshida hit the ball to the area in between shortstop and third base, allowing Brett Baty to make the throw to first, but Durran tried to stretch out the play by making a move to third with no one covering the bag.
Despite Carrasco missing the throw to third and the ball ending up in the outfield, the Mets still managed to get the runner out to pull off the double play when Duran tried reaching home and Mark Canha threw him out.

Sunday was Carrasco’s 14th start of the season, and he entered the game with a 5.35 ERA.
The starter was 3-3 going into the final game of the three-game series between the Mets and Red Sox.

aa286983-034c-4ddc-b2e4-977a10c40550,"3 expert tips to ""fall back"" for daylight saving time 2023 without getting seasonal affective disorder","Could daylight saving become thing of the past? Could daylight saving time become thing of the past? 01:59
Gaining an hour of sleep as daylight saving time ends on Nov. 5 might sound like a win, but experts say there are still ways that ""falling back"" can disrupt our health.
""Despite the gaining or losing an hour, one of the things that we can expect is the light exposure (to change),"" explains Blair Steel, a licensed clinical psychologist. ""And we know that less morning light can decrease levels of mood-boosting hormones, such as serotonin.""
Being aware of these changes — and taking steps to address their impact — can also help shore up your defenses against the winter blues or seasonal depression, clinically known as seasonal affective disorder, or SAD.
About 3% to 5% of people may develop SAD, says Vanessa Kennedy, director of psychology at Driftwood Recovery, explaining that it typically involves the onset of ""depressed mood in the fall or winter seasons when weather conditions become rainy, cold and gloomy for an extended period of time.""
""Reduced hours of sunlight that come along with ending daylight saving time in the fall can exacerbate these symptoms,"" she noted.
So how can you cope? Try these tips:
1. Use light to your advantage
""Even though you may have an extra hour of sleep, it's important to balance that with having some light in the morning,"" Steel suggests. ""If you go to work after (the time change), and you come home and you're driving home in the dark, that can certainly increase depression.""
If your schedule or gloomy weather keeps you from experiencing natural light during your day, consider light-box therapy or special lamps that mimic the sun.
""Indoor light-box devices mimic the effects of natural sunlight, contributing to normalization of hormone and vitamin levels and setting up the right biological factors to improve mood,"" Kennedy says.
Or, consider changing up your surroundings temporarily if the weather affects your mood significantly.
""Going to a sunnier, warmer climate for a getaway, or planning to work remotely for fall and winter months if possible can be a way to ward off depression and maintain your happiness,"" Kennedy says.
2. Exercise and reframe to boost mood
Need another pick-me-up when light is lacking? Try exercise.
""Regular exercise can increase serotonin levels and boost mood,"" Kennedy says. ""While exercising outdoors may not always be possible during bad weather, exercising indoors or adopting outdoor fall or winter exercises that incorporate nature can be beneficial.""
Kennedy also suggests reframing the meaning of reduced daylight to give it new significance.
""When it gets dark early, you can enjoy different activities, such as movie nights, holiday lights, evening gatherings, s'mores by a fire, stargazing or developing a more thorough winding-down routine before bed,"" she says. ""When you develop new associations between reduced daylight and positive activities, your mood can benefit.""
3. Be aware of warning signs
For some people, increased light and movement might not be enough to avoid seasonal depression. If this is the case, Steel says you should be aware of some warning signs it may be time to seek professional help.
One common sign is an inability to experience pleasure.
""If there are things that you typically enjoy, and you just aren't able to feel that same level of joy, whether it's music or time with friends, that's definitely a red flag,"" she says. This may be coupled with increasing isolation.
""Isolation is something that you see with many kinds of mental health conditions,"" she adds. ""So if you see if you're isolating, it's definitely time to get some help.""
Other signs to look for include a dramatic increase or decrease in appetite or sleep, she says.
If you are feeling depressed as the days grow shorter — or any time of year — there are treatment options, including therapy and antidepressant medications, that may help.
""Talk to your health care provider about which treatment, or combination of treatments, is best for you,"" the National Institute of Mental Health advises. It offers some resources on its website for how to find help."

5822cce1-70ab-48c7-93f9-ab1ad0e98870,"Soon-to-be bride, dog mauled at park weeks before wedding","A day out at a dog park almost ended in tragedy for a miniature dachshund and its owner, who were both aggressively attacked by a larger breed.
Just weeks out from her fairytale wedding, bodybuilder Isabelle Payne and her four-legged fur baby Lola fell victim to a shocking mauling when they were set upon by a hostile bull terrier.
The pair were with Payne’s fiancé Jacob Thirkettle at an off-leash park on the Gold Coast on Wednesday when the “unprovoked” attack unfolded.
Both the bride-to-be and her dog sustained horrific injuries, with Payne enduring a number of bruises, scratches and punctures from being bitten in the attack.

Meanwhile Lola was severely injured, with her injuries potentially life-threatening if Payne didn’t step in.
The incident occurred just seven weeks prior to Payne and Thirkettle tying the knot.
“One of the worst possible things happened to Lola, our 3-year-old miniature dachshund and Isabelle, my fiancée,” Thirkettle wrote on a GoFundMe page set up for the pair.

“They were both attacked unprovoked and mauled by another dog while at an off-leash dog park on the Gold Coast and my fiancé was very badly injured trying to extract Lola from its grip.”
“Safe to say that without Isabelle‘s quick thinking Lola wouldn’t be here with us today.”
Thirkettle continued by thanking members of the community who assisted his partner and their dog by coming “to their rescue.”

Following the incident, Lola was rushed to the vet where she underwent surgery to repair lacerations on her back and the fur near her ribcage.
“Lola’s operation went well but she still has a long journey ahead with her recovery and it’s early days,” Thirkettle said.
The soon-to-be wedded couple set up the GoFundMe page in a bid to save up enough money to cover Lola’s vet bills, with the dachshund requiring further vet visits and ongoing treatment.

“We’re honestly just so grateful to everyone and are deeply overwhelmed by the love and incredible support. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.”

b91902e9-7594-46a0-bfb1-e7980d37e14e,Migrants with babies selling mangoes on dangerous NYC roads,"Some of New York City’s busiest highways and roads are drawing migrant moms so desperate to make a buck that they hawk mangoes and drinks in traffic — often with babies strapped to their backs.
Along the bustling, notoriously dangerous intersection of Woodhaven Boulevard and Myrtle Avenue in Queens on Friday, two young mothers who illegally migrated three months ago from Ecuador peddled cups of fruit for $5 a pop and bottles of water for a buck.
Maria, 20, had her year-old infant strapped to her back.
Veronica, 25, carried her 3-year-old daughter the same way, weaving around cars to score sales when traffic stopped for a red light.
“We don’t want to be on the street,” said Veronica.
“What we want in this country is a real job.”
“A lot of people who see us selling here take pictures and videos of us, and say ‘You can’t be here selling like this’ and ‘Not with your baby,'” added Veronica, who shares a two-bedroom Brooklyn apartment with five family members.
But “some days there is no one to leave them with … [and] if we don’t work, we can’t pay the rent [and buy] food … for the babies.”
Maria said she has little choice when the alternative is not working.
2 young mothers who illegally migrated 3 months ago from Ecuador peddled cups of fruit for $5 a pop and bottles of water for a buck on the intersection of Woodhaven Boulevard and Myrtle Avenue in Queens. Stephen Yang
“We can’t find jobs — that’s why we are selling,” said Maria, who rents a single room at a Jamaica apartment with her sister.
“I don’t want to keep doing this. I want a real job — not this.”
Both women say they recently met selling fruit at the intersection and became friends.
They work three to four days a week, four to five hours at a time.
They said they typically spend $100 at a local market buying up three days worth of fruit to flip for profits, and usually sell 10 to 15 cups a day.
Maria, 20, had her year-old infant strapped to her back, and Veronica, 25, carried her 3-year-old daughter the same way, weaving around cars to score sales when traffic stopped for a red light. JC Rice
Whatever they can’t sell, they eat.
Along a ramp by the busy Van Wyck Expressway in Queens, near the Horace Harding Expressway, another Ecuadorian migrant, Llosa 39, was accompanied Wednesday by her 12-year-old son while selling cups of fruit for $5.
“It’s dangerous,” she said.
“It scares me for him and for me. But I need to do it to occupy my mind and earn money. Who is going to make money for us to have food if not me?”
Both arrived illegally in the U.S. a month ago.
Llosa said the child accompanies her because there’s no one else to care for him.
“We’re not doing anything bad,” insisted Llosa, who estimates earning about $70 a day in profits — provided she sells all $30 of fruit she purchases at local markets.

“We’re not robbing anyone.”
Over the past two weeks, Post reporters have also spotted women accompanied with kids selling fruit on the Harlem River Drive, FDR Drive and West Side Highway in Manhattan.
Councilman Robert Holden (D-Queens) said he sympathizes with the unlicensed fruit sellers but added they’re putting themselves and children at serious risk.
In a letter last week to Mayor Adams, he demanded the NYPD do a better job cracking down.
“These children are constantly exposed to toxic fumes and the possibility of a catastrophic accident that could kill or maim them and their families,” said Holden, adding he suspects organized gangs could be involved and taking advantage of the sellers.
All of the migrants interviewed by the Post insisted they were working independently.
The moderate Dem said he fired off the letter out of frustration after previously expressing his concerns in Aug. 29 letters to NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell and Administration for Children’s Services Commissioner Jess Dannhauser but getting nowhere.
Sewell told Holden NYPD’s goal “is not to summons or arrest our way out of the issue, but rather gain voluntary compliance” by educating migrants and homeless people on the law and connecting them with city services.
The NYPD provided a similar answer to The Post in July when it exposed that the FDR Drive and other major New York City highways had suddenly become hotspots for predominately homeless panhandlers willing to risk their lives to solicit spare change from motorists.
However, Holden said the highway panhandling problem has since gotten much worse based on recent complaints he’s fielded from constituents.
He said he believes the recent mass influx of asylum-seeking migrants into the city spurred a rise in mango-selling moms and their kids working the roads, too.
Messages left with the Mayor’s Office and NYPD were not returned."

CAMBRIDGE - Harvard President Claudine Gay will stay in office after getting support from the highest governing body at the school Tuesday.
""In this tumultuous and difficult time, we unanimously stand in support of President Gay,"" the Harvard Corporation said in a statement.
Gay and the presidents of MIT and the University of Pennsylvania have been under intense criticism since last week when they each testified before Congress about antisemitism on college campuses.
Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik asked Gay, ""At Harvard, does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Harvard's rules of bullying and harassment, yes, or no?""
""It can be, depending on the context,"" Gay said.
After their testimony, more than 70 members of Congress, mostly Republicans, demanded all three presidents resign. University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill resigned Saturday.
""I am sorry,"" Gay later told the Harvard Crimson. ""Words matter.""
Hundreds of faculty at Harvard signed a letter calling for the university's two governing boards to resist pressure from politicians and donors to force Gay to resign.
The Harvard Corporation, the highest governing body at the school, met to discuss Gay's future at the university Monday.
""We today reaffirm our support for President Gay's continued leadership of Harvard University,"" they said in a statement Tuesday morning. ""Our extensive deliberations affirm our confidence that President Gay is the right leader to help our community heal and to address the very serious societal issues we are facing.""
""President Gay has apologized for how she handled her congressional testimony and has committed to redoubling the University's fight against antisemitism,"" the corporation said in their letter to ""the Harvard Community.""
Gay has also been accused of plagiarizing portions of her PhD thesis. In a statement to the Boston Globe, she said ""I stand by the integrity of my scholarship.""
The corporation also addressed that issue in their statement, saying, ""With regard to President Gay's academic writings, the University became aware in late October of allegations regarding three articles. At President Gay's request, the Fellows promptly initiated an independent review by distinguished political scientists and conducted a review of her published work. On December 9, the Fellows reviewed the results, which revealed a few instances of inadequate citation. While the analysis found no violation of Harvard's standards for research misconduct, President Gay is proactively requesting four corrections in two articles to insert citations and quotation marks that were omitted from the original publications.""
MIT president Sally Kornbluth has also refused to resign. The school's governing board said she has their ""full and unreserved support."""

Harry Brook (left) previously played in the Big Bash for Hobart Hurricanes, while Heather Knight (right) won the women's competition with Sydney Thunder in 2021
Harry Brook and Heather Knight were among 19 England players selected in the Big Bash League draft.
Women's captain Knight joined Sydney Thunder as eight English players were picked in the inaugural draft for the women's T20 competition.
Brook was second pick in the men's draft as he joined Melbourne Stars.
Eleven English men's players were drafted including bowler Chris Jordan to Hobart Hurricanes and batter Alex Hales being retained by Sydney Thunder.
This was the second time an overseas draft has taken place for the men's BBL, which is now in its 12th year and will run from 7 December to 24 January.
That means Brook's availability may be limited with England due to tour West Indies in a white-ball series between 3-21 December and then travel to India for a five-Test series from 25 January.
Other England players selected include leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed, all-rounder Tom Curran and batter James Vince, a two-time winner of the competition, joining Sydney Sixers.
Perth Scorchers, who have lifted the title in each of the past two years, retained Surrey batter Laurie Evans and signed England Test opener Zak Crawley.
Adelaide Strikers kept Warwickshire batter Adam Hose and signed Surrey bowling all-rounder Jamie Overton, who was named player of the tournament in this year's Hundred.
England wicketkeeper Sam Billings and Essex all-rounder Paul Walter joined Brisbane Heat, while Warwickshire batter Sam Hain joined Jordan at Hurricanes.
The Stars attempted to sign Afghanistan leg-spinner Rashid Khan as their first draft pick for the second year running, before the Strikers chose to retain him and they instead went with Brook.
South Africa wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock will make his debut in the competition after being selected by Melbourne Renegades.
In total, 21 overseas players were signed from the 376 who put themselves forward for the draft with New Zealand batter Martin Guptill and former South Africa captain Faf du Plessis among those not selected.

In the women's draft, South Africa all-rounder Marizanne Kapp signed for Sydney Thunder as number one pick after she was not retained by Perth Scorchers.
Scorchers instead opted to retain skipper Sophie Devine of New Zealand, with England opener Danni Wyatt also heading to Perth.
Lauren Bell joins international team-mate Knight at Thunder, while Alice Capsey and Maia Bouchier were signed by Melbourne Stars.
Elsewhere, Bryony Smith signed for Hobart Hurricanes, Bess Heath was selected by Brisbane Heat and Dani Gibson went to Adelaide strikers.
Fellow England internationals Kate Cross, Issy Wong and Sarah Glenn were among those not selected.
Tammy Beaumont, Amy Jones and Sophia Dunkley opted to skip the draft and go through the direct nomination stage, meaning sides can negotiate a contract with them outside of the draft.
The WBBL, now in its ninth year, will run from 19 October to 2 December."

d63a98d0-7553-46a1-9049-b34b5ebacdc0,Polyamory and Molly Roden Winter’s memoir More are suddenly everywhere,"Everyone’s talking about polyamory. You might have read about it, at least if you pay attention to the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the New Yorker, the Washington Post, the Atlantic, or New York magazine, or if you listen to podcasts like Esther Perel’s Where Should We Begin? and The Ezra Klein Show. Maybe you’ve seen versions of polyamory plots on TV, like Succession’s Shiv Roy and Tom Wambsgans’s shaky open marriage or the Riverdale finale’s reveal that its four main characters spend their senior year in a quad. Perhaps you’ve noticed that, in many of these cases, the news peg is the release of Molly Roden Winter’s new memoir, More, an account of the writer’s 10 years in an open marriage.

Why this one account of polyamory — the practice of having consensual romantic or sexual relationships with multiple people — went so viral is anyone’s guess: It’s not as if people haven’t written memoirs about nonmonogamy before, and the reviews so far have been mixed. While many praise her perspective as a mother pushing back against stereotypes about who gets to have the sex they want and who doesn’t, much of the criticism has revolved around Winter’s privilege, some of which feels fair (that she seemed to lack empathy for the younger, less wealthy secondary partners involved in her marriage) and some less so (the fact that she’s a homeowner in a fancy part of America’s biggest city is obviously a main reason major media outlets are talking about her book, but it’s not as if she’s claiming a universal experience).
Yet the current discursive fever pitch on polyamory isn’t just about Winter’s memoir. It’s also not just about polyamory, a practice that has existed for millennia, though mainstream interest in it has spiked from time to time. Christopher Gleason, historian and author of the new book American Poly, explains that in the ’80s and ’90s, poly activists attempted to destigmatize the practice by contextualizing it within Reagan-era moral standards. But this moment, he says, feels bigger than any we’ve had so far: “Americans in general, we’re rethinking intimate relationships on a much deeper level.”
Consider the data: There’s currently a record-high share of 40-year-old Americans who’ve never been married (25 percent, as of 2021, an increase from 20 percent in 2010 and six percent in 1980), and according to a Pew Center study last year, only 23 percent of Americans see marriage as essential for living a fulfilling life. More than half of single Americans say they aren’t looking for a relationship or even casual dates, largely because they enjoy singlehood or have more pressing priorities. The birth rate has been steadily falling since the Great Recession, which the Brookings Institution argues stems from “shifting priorities” rather than political or economic changes. Young people are having sex later; from 1991 to 2015, a CDC survey found that the percentage of high schoolers who’d had intercourse dropped from 54 percent to 41 percent. The reasons people are having less sex, according to the viral “sex recession” Atlantic feature from 2018, range from smartphone access to surveillance culture, gamified online dating, and improved awareness of boundaries and gender politics. In other words, it’s likely a variety of cultural shifts that explain these changes rather than a single silver bullet.
Americans’ attitudes toward monogamy have evolved in tandem: More than one in five single folks have engaged in some form of consensual nonmonogamy, nearly one-third of people in monogamous relationships say their favorite sexual fantasy involves some kind of open relationship, and 51 percent of adults under 30 say that open marriages are acceptable. Openly queer people, who tend to be more likely to approve of different forms of polyamory, now make up a larger percentage of the population, with 17 percent of adults under 30 identifying as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. Anyone who’s used a dating app has likely confronted the choice to list oneself as “ethically nonmonogamous,” and with the mainstreaming of apps like Feeld, which are specifically geared toward kink, threesomes, and other forms of polyamory, these terms are now part of everyday relationship discourse.
The pandemic also may have accelerated this: Around 2021, explains Leanne Yau, polyamory educator and founder of the blog Poly Philia, “People came out of a very profound period of isolation, and it led to a lot of people reconsidering the decisions they made and perhaps wanting to explore something different.”
In response, the pro-marriage cohort is getting louder. They cite studies that show married people are happier and wealthier, and are more likely to raise happy children. New York Times columnist David Brooks last year advised young people to “obsess less about your career and to think a lot more about marriage.” Economist Melissa Kearney’s recent book argues that the falling marriage rate is to blame for rising inequality. In the face of greater political polarization between the sexes (young women are increasingly likely to be liberal, young men conservative), a recent Washington Post op-ed suggested that “someone will need to compromise” if they ever hope to marry. (Left unasked was why, say, a woman in a post-Roe world would ever want to date someone who did not think she deserved autonomy over her own body.) Loudest among them is University of Virginia sociologist Brad Wilcox’s book Get Married: Why Americans Must Defy the Elites, Forge Strong Families, and Save Civilization, which claims that liberal thought leaders’ denial of the importance of marriage amounts to “an unusual form of hypocrisy that, however well intended, contributes to American inequality, increases misery, and borders on the immoral.”
And those are just the fancy people with book deals and newspaper columns. All over the internet, regular folks are freaking out about marriage, sexuality, and gender, too: You’ve likely heard of tradwives, or women who make public performances of their adherence to old-fashioned gender norms — some of whom do so while selling overpriced cookware and downplaying their connections to billionaires. Maybe you’ve seen men proudly claim to eschew masturbation because they believe that semen retention holds the key to one’s true masculine energy. (Heard of the Liver King? If not, don’t Google it.) One of the most popular influencers among teenage boys is a proud misogynist who speaks frequently about his disrespect for women’s autonomy (and is currently awaiting trial for rape and human trafficking). Conservative talking heads moan about “blue hair and pronouns” while TikTok “experts” encourage women to date exclusively for money in a kind of depressing, warped version of feminism where the only thing a man might have to offer a woman is financial security and designer purses.
All of these phenomena are responses to changing sexual norms and declining marriage rates. As is, I’d argue, the reason why polyamory is striking such a chord right now: People panic when they’ve been confronted with their own freedom. “It can be very comforting to go on a set path: be exclusive, get married, and have kids,” explains Yau. “Knowing that there are options outside of that can be a really terrifying prospect for people who might never have questioned this kind of thing in their lives.”
“I think [people] are really nervous that it’s contagious”
It is, naturally, quite difficult to have frank discussions about marriage and monogamy. There are feelings and money and families involved, and the idea of infidelity in particular is uncomfortable and emotional for many. “A lot of people have trauma around that, and seeing people enthusiastically embrace having [multiple partners] and openly practicing something they see as a betrayal of trust is a fundamentally destabilizing experience for them, even though the point of polyamory is that everyone is open and consenting,” says Yau.
“I think [people] are really nervous that it’s contagious,” adds Jessica Fern, author of two popular books about navigating attachment and nonmonogamy, Polysecure and Polywise. “There’s a real fear, that, ‘If my husband hears that this is an option, he’s gonna want it, and I don’t necessarily want to do that.’” A big portion of society will also tend to view polyamory as something exclusively beneficial to men, which Gleason points out misunderstands polyamory’s roots in American culture. Sexual freedom has always been the end goal for the feminist and queer liberation movements, without which polyamory wouldn’t be a point of discussion at all.
For single straight women, it can often feel as though the number of men listing themselves as ethically nonmonogamous on dating apps is an indication that they, as one woman described to Vogue, “use non-monogamy to convey a sense that they are so free-spirited that they simply cannot be pinned down” as a means to avoid any emotional responsibility in relationships. Dating apps, according to pretty much everyone, are “in their flop era,” overrun with bots and sneaky paid features designed to get you to fork over money to connect with anyone you’d actually want to date. “There’s a much bigger swath of the population that is experiencing their lives as single, and not just as a ‘phase’ in your 20s. Your long-term reality is a succession of relationships or short-term arrangements, and I think that percentage is probably going to grow,” says Emily Witt, author of Future Sex: A New Kind of Free Love.
With more people marrying later and fewer people marrying at all, many of us will be rethinking how we organize our lives. That can be a hugely positive exercise: In The Other Significant Others: Reimagining Life With Friendship at the Center, NPR’s Rhaina Cohen makes the case for handling questions of child care, elder care, and living arrangements not with marriage as the de facto support system but strong platonic relationships. Polyamorists have also contributed to this reimagining: We live in a world “built for the couple,” per Fern, but what would it look like when parental rights, estate planning, or even architecture (why should a house only have one primary bedroom, for instance?) were built for more than just two people in a romantic relationship?
“There’s been this deconstruction wave for the last few decades,” says Fern. “Straightness was deconstructed, and then gender’s been deconstructed. And now it’s monogamy’s turn.” While the prospect of a life outside monogamy and marriage might threaten people’s images of the lives they imagined they’d have, it could also allow people the freedom to create something potentially even more meaningful.
“We all get really exhausted with internet dating, but I think it’s good to remind ourselves how amazing it is,” says Witt. “You can go have a drink with somebody, and even if they’re not the love of your life, at least you’re meeting people. You’re not doing this on your own, you’re not some social outcast, and there’s like a lot of other people in the same boat.” If the discourse around polyamory is encouraging people to be more honest about their desires, to examine their lives more clearly, and communicate more directly with their current and potential partners, and to question the value of societal expectations, then that feels like a win — even if you don’t have any interest in participating.

Host Tom Llamas asked, “Assistant Secretary, do you think it was the right move to sort of rapidly release all of those migrants? Again, process them, take them in, vet them, give them a court date, but we were talking about tens of thousands of migrants who are now out on the streets of America, and, in many cases, putting pressure on local governments who do not have the room to house them.”
Nuñez-Neto responded, “So, I would say a couple of things there: The first is that, as you noted, every individual we process is thoroughly vetted against our national security and public safety systems. And any individual who could pose a threat to the community — individuals with outstanding warrants or individuals who may have a link to terrorism — are detained and are not released. And I would also say that presidents of both parties have, at times, had to release individuals from custody in order to ensure the safety and well-being of the migrants in our custody, but also of the men and women who work for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. And the last point I would make here is that we appreciate and really understand the cost that our communities are bearing when it comes to the challenge posed by migration to the border and we view those as the costs of a fundamentally broken system that the U.S. Congress has not updated in decades.”

Famous for being a “first mover” in the all-inclusive space, Sandals Resorts has tweaked its model many times over its more than four decades of operation. In its latest reboot, the resort brand is leaning into local experiences and culinary culture at its destinations to appeal to vacationers looking for more immersive experiences.
“There’s been this sort of remarkable resurgence in the desire and deep appreciation of travel,” says Adam Stewart, executive chairman of Sandals Resorts International. He calls it a “newfound curiosity,” and it has been fueling the brand’s business since the end of the pandemic. This boost in travel comes at a time that Sandals is investing in other parts of the business.
Offsite dining brings customers to local flavors
Bon Vivants restaurant in the Bahamas is one of the options available to Sandals guests. Sandals
One of its most exciting programs is the expansion of offsite dining. This involves on-the-ground research from the Sandals team that visits local restaurants, collaborates with their chefs and assures top food quality and safety for guests. Best of all, this is included in the overall room rate for guests with the number of times they can dine offsite usually based on the number of nights during their stay.
Sandals provides free transfers for guests to these local restaurants, but in some locations like Curacao, guests can also borrow one of the resorts Mini Cooper cars to get there. These complimentary additions give guests more time to explore off-property without having to pay for excursions or other tours.
The Kurason Island suites at the new Sandals in Curacao. Sandals
These experiences are currently available at Sandals Royal Curacao and Sandals Royal Bahamian with more resorts like Sandals Dunn’s River in Ocho Rios, Jamaica to come soon.
In the Bahamas, guests can dine offsite at Sapodilla Estate, a restaurant with live music in what was once a private home, and Cocoplum, a cafe serving a fusion of French and Mediterranean cuisine with an island twist.
Guests at the Curacao property can visit Kome specializing in wood-fired meats, and Soi95, a contemporary Asian spot with mixology experiences. At Sal, The Kitchen, diners sit in a unique setting with walls built out of coral and salt.
Evolving the food and beverage scene
Zuka is the Latin American fusion restaurant at Sandal's Dunns River Falls in Jamaica. Sandals
When all-inclusive resorts were at their dawn, they were known for large buffet spreads designed to impress with quantity (sometimes over quality). This has been part of the financial model for many all-inclusive brands, but Sandals knows that people travel for good food and experience with their taste buds.
Sandals properties are more likely now to have just one or two buffet venues, opting instead for themed dining rooms that explore international menus. It’s not just Italian, French and Mexican anymore. Sandals Dunn’s River has a popular steakhouse, sushi and teppanyaki venues, Greek and Spanish flavors. An upscale rum bar concept with a tapas menu that takes local dishes and gives them a new spin is also expanding to more resorts.
The new rum bar concept at Sandals Dunns River Falls in Jamaica. Sandals
A new speakeasy-style bar has proven quite popular with guests, especially younger travelers, looking for less formulaic entertainment options and something unique.
Instead of tapping celebrity chefs to headline its restaurants, it is taking its own approach on delivering local quality both on and off resort property.
Hanami has both sushi and teppanyaki menus at Sandals Dunns River Falls in Jamaica making it one of ... [+] the most popular specialty restaurants. Sandals
Its headquarters in Fort Lauderdale is getting some new additions, too. This includes a new test kitchen where its food and beverage research and development team can test new recipes, tweak them to offer unique takes on traditional dishes and design menus that appeal to evolving dietary habits. The growing team focused on culinary pursuits is no stranger to delivering high quality, and many have come from well-known luxury brands like Peninsula, Montage and Fairmont among others.
The brand notes that there are more vegetarian and vegan menus than ever before, and its menus must take that into account. Also appearing on menus are more descriptions of international dishes, pronunciation guides to understand how to say certain food names and more storytelling about the destination’s culinary history. The F&B team visits local markets and spends time with island chefs in each destination to learn more about local recipes.

Sandals has opened several new properties in recent years including Sandals Dunn’s River Falls in Jamaica and Sandals Curacao. Both of these properties are at the forefront of the recent changes with more properties to follow soon. This is all part of a growing effort to reach new Caribbean markets beyond its original, mostly English-speaking destinations. In the future, the brand sees expansion into more French, Spanish and Dutch-speaking islands to grow its network.
Expanded terraces, often with ceiling fans and soaking tubs, are hallmarks of a growing number of premium accommodations. The Dunn’s River Falls property, like many others, has an entire wing dedicated to upgraded offering with butler service and lounge access.
Sandals is unique in offering overwater villas in the Caribbean, something typically only found in ... [+] the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Sandals
Perhaps one of the most exciting developments for the brand is an increase in the number of overwater villas being added to Sandals properties. Until now, travelers are more likely to fly to far-flung destinations like the Maldives or French Polynesia to find them. Sandals wants to change that and offers that at several properties like Sandals Royal Caribbean Spa Resort & Offshore Island and coming soon to Sandals Dunn’s River Falls.
Other properties with overwater villas include Sandals South Coast and Sandals Royal Caribbean in Jamaica and Sandals Grande St. Lucia. Sandals’ newest resort (the 18th in the portfolio), the adults-only Sandals Saint Vincent, which opens March 27, will be home to the brand’s first ever two-story over-the-water villas, tucked into a private cove.
Sandals St. Vincent is one of the brand's adults-only resorts. Sandals
This brand evolution could not come at a more opportune time now that the big hospitality players are growing their all-inclusive lineup. Hyatt, Marriott, Hilton and IHG have all launched their own brands or partnered with others to quickly boost their portfolio in this burgeoning field. With the investments Sandals is making to elevate food and beverage experiences, overdeliver in guest rooms, and add new overwater villas and overall destinations, the competition gives travelers more variety and cultural immersion than ever before.
“We’re honing in on the programs that get our guests closer to the heart of the Caribbean, with each island’s natural beauty, culture, people and flavors drawing them in to make more memorable and meaningful vacation experiences,” adds Stewart.
And for Sandals reservations department, this approach appears to be working with great success."
7c856501-5d60-449a-a2f0-23be6d841134,Biden Says He’s ‘Not Surprised’ About Reported Prigozhin Plane Crash,"President Joe Biden said he’s “not surprised” about the plane crash that reportedly killed Russian mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, speculating Russian President Vladimir Putin may be responsible.
Prigozhin, the leader of Russia’s Wagner Group, was reportedly listed as being onboard a plane that crashed over Moscow on Wednesday. The Wagner Group had attempted a coup on the Russian capital in late June, arguing the Russian government was taking credit for their victories in the war on Ukraine. (RELATED: Russian Mercenary Leader Who Attempted Coup Listed As Passenger On Crashed Plane: REPORT)
Reuters’ Steve Holland asked Biden about the plane crash after the president exited a workout class.
“You may recall, when I was asked about this by you, I said I’d be careful what I rode in. I don’t know for a fact what happened but I’m not surprised,” Biden responded.
“There’s not much that happens in Russia that Putin’s not behind. But I don’t know enough to know the answer. I’ve been working out for the last hour and a half,” the president added.

8ca5fe65-e5fa-40dd-83ad-824b5c4d8ddf,"Trocheck has goal, two assists as Rangers rally for win over Predators","NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Vincent Trocheck had a goal and two assists, and the New York Rangers rallied from two goals down to beat the Nashville Predators 4-3 on Saturday.
Jacob Trouba, Chris Kreider and Ryan Lindgren also scored for New York, winners of five of six. Adam Fox had three assists and Jonny Brodzinski added two, and Igor Shesterkin stopped 36 shots.
The Rangers trailed 2-0 and 3-1 before scoring three straight to get their league-best 17th win.
""We didn't get off to a good start, but found a way to calm ourselves down in between (the first two) periods and found a way to pick our game back up and played a really good second,"" Trouba said.
Ryan O'Reilly had a goal and an assist, and Roman Josi and Colton Sissons also scored for Nashville, who have lost consecutive games after winning six straight. Kevin Lankinen made 23 saves.
Sissons made it 3-1 at 7:28 of the second, scoring on a short-handed breakaway. It gave him all three of Nashville's short-handed goals this season. Entering Saturday, the Islanders' Simon Holmstrom and Colorado's Logan O'Connor were tied for the NHL lead with three short-handed goals.
""I thought we played pretty well, carried the play,"" Nashville coach Andrew Brunette said. ""Unfortunately, a couple of lack of details in critical moments kind of cost us the hockey game.""
Kreider drew New York back within a goal at 8:52, just after that power play expired. It was his 14th of the season.
Just 19 seconds later, with the Rangers back on a power play, Trocheck redirected Mika Zibanejad's pass past Lankinen to tie the score.
""He really cranked it up,"" New York coach Peter Laviolette said of Trocheck. ""He played a great game.""
Lindgren then gave the Rangers their first lead of the day at 5:10 of the third, when his pass attempt from the left circle hit off of the skate of Predators defenseman Jeremy Lauzon in front and past Lankinen.
""I just threw it out there, it hit a skate and went in,"" Lindgren said.
O'Reilly scored the game's first goal at 6:19 of the opening period. Liam Foudy's cross-ice passing attempt deflected off the stick of New York forward Will Cuylle and right to O'Reilly in the left circle, where he beat Shesterkin on the short side with a wrist shot.
O'Reilly's 11 goals place him one behind Filip Forsberg for the team lead.
Josi doubled the Nashville lead with 4:08 left in the first. With the Predators on a power play, Josi stickhandled to the high slot before snapping a wrist shot through traffic past Shesterkin low on the stick side.
""Obviously, you don't want to lose that game,"" Josi said. ""I thought we played pretty well and probably deserved to win.""
Trouba got the Rangers on the scoreboard 31 seconds into the second when Trocheck found him in front with a pass from behind the Nashville net.

Marine conservationists were among the horrified cruise ship passengers who witnessed the slaughtering of 78 whales last week.
Ambassador Cruise Line issued an apology on Twitter after its Ambition ship docked in the Faroe Islands at the same time a group carried out its regular hunting of pilot whales. The islands are a self-governing part of Denmark about halfway between Iceland and Norway.
The cruise docked in the Faroese port of Torshavn last Sunday as locals carried out their sixth hunt of the year. Nine calves no older than a month were among the 78 whales slaughtered, conservation and campaign group ORCA said.
In a press release, ORCA said some of its conservationists were on the ship with tourists when the killings took place.
ORCA said its conservationists witnessed more than 40 small boats and jet skis herd the whales into shallow waters before 150 hunters slaughtered the 78 whales with hooks and ""killing lances"" in 20 minutes.
The group said some of the pilot whales, including a calf, took more than 30 seconds to die.
Sally Hamilton, the CEO of ORCA, said in a statement it ""defies belief"" that Faroese authorities allowed the hunt to take place in the view of the cruise ship.
""It's almost as if they are flaunting the hunt and taunting the tourists,"" she said.
According to Visit Faroe Islands, about 800 whales are killed annually and meat is distributed among those who participate.
Islanders say the practice has been deemed sustainable due to the whale population in the area.
In a statement shared with ORCA, Ambassador said while the practice was a traditional way of sustaining communities, it had now become ""outdated"" and had instead turned commercial, with whale meat being sold in local supermarkets.
""We are utterly opposed to the commercial hunting of whales and dolphins in the Faroes, or anywhere else come to that,"" Ambassador said.
Visit Faroe Islands didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider, made outside normal working hours."

“We want to make sure that we put in place security arrangements for Ukraine for the long term, so that we send a very strong signal to Vladimir Putin that we’re not going anywhere,” Sunak went on to say. “We are here to stay and we will continue backing Ukraine, not just now but for years into the future.”

Sunak might have a point: Ukraine would be right at home on NATO's ever-growing list of nations free-riding off of American security.
The most recent addition, Finland, currently fails to meet the alliance's ‘requirement’ for members to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense spending. No matter; come on in! Hardly anyone follows that rule. Before Finland, North Macedonia (or whatever they’re calling themselves these days) joined the alliance in 2020. It spends about 1.5 percent of its GDP on defense annually, which amounts to $219 billion and ranks second to last in total contributions to the alliance. The only country that provides less to the NATO alliance than North Macedonia is the country that joined before it, Montenegro, which spends $97 billion on defense per year, far below 2 percent of its GDP.
Thank goodness a country that can’t even agree on a name and another that's essentially a movie-set granted nation state status are safe from the territorial ambitions of the Russians. Don’t you know, ensuring Hollywood has a place to film the next Marvel movie is a core strategic interest of the United States? And, rest assured, if the American homeland is invaded, Montenegro and North Macedonia have promised they will come to our rescue.
Ukraine, a country completely reliant on the West for not only weapons but to keep their entire government afloat, will fit right in with the others currently huddling for shelter under America’s nuclear umbrella."
5aaca8c8-5f88-4edc-a121-734de64eab8a,Prominent lobbyist appeals 5-year prison sentence in historic Ohio corruption scheme,"COLUMBUS, Ohio — Lobbyist Matt Borges appealed his 5-year sentence late Wednesday in the $60 million bribery scheme that also took down former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder.
Borges, 51, a former chair of the Ohio Republican Party, was convicted in March of racketeering alongside Householder.
Authorities said the scheme involved secret payments to Akron-based utility FirstEnergy Corp. to secure Householder’s power, elect his allies to the Legislature, pass legislation containing a $1.3 billion bailout of two aging nuclear plants owned by a FirstEnergy affiliate, and then foil efforts to repeal the new law.
Prosecutors said Borges’ primary role in the enterprise was to deprive Ohioans of the opportunity to overturn what he knew was corrupt legislation and had called the result of an “unholy alliance.” Jurors were presented evidence that he was budgeted $25,000, which he laundered through his own bank accounts to bribe a political operative for secret, real-time information on the referendum campaign against the bailout bill, known as House Bill 6.
U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Black gave Borges the low end of the 5- to 8-year range recommended by federal prosecutors after he expressed remorse at his sentencing hearing and asked for leniency. Borges’ lawyers had recommended he get 1 1/2 years.
Black’s decision concerning Borges came a day after the judge sentenced the 64-year-old Householder to 20 years in prison, the maximum allowed under the law, and a year of probation. Householder also has appealed.
During trial, Borges’ attorneys argued that the lobbyist had only a minor, short-term role in the massive operation, in which two other individuals, a dark money group and FirstEnergy have all acknowledged their guilt.
Several fired FirstEnergy executives and the former head of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio also have been investigated in a sweeping probe that remains open."

[+] the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) National Convention, in Boston, Massachusetts, on June 27, 2023. (Photo by Joseph Prezioso / AFP) (Photo by JOSEPH PREZIOSO/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images
The phrase “the road to hell is paved with good intentions” proved fitting this week when Boston Mayor Michelle Wu’s attempt to convene an affinity-group holiday party for officials of color backfired due to careless vetting of the invitee list. A staff oversight turned into a growing public relations migraine after invites for the private holiday event wrongly included white city councilors, who subsequently lashed out at their deliberate exclusion.
The controversy over a segregated holiday gathering exposes how even the most progressive leaders can unconsciously perpetuate racial divides. Despite Boston’s reputation as an enlightened, inclusive city under the helm of Mayor Wu, an invitation excluding people such as City Councilman Frank Baker purely for being white signals deep schisms still requiring redress. Though Mayor Wu soon apologized, the initial invitation underscores growing divisions that inclusive leaders must work to heal, not exacerbate. Simply put, exclusive events cannot mend systemic prejudice - they will only inflame it.
Affinity groups based on race or background have an understandable appeal for those seeking cultural comfort among peers. However, by definition, they promote exclusivity over inclusivity. The understandable desire for affirmative fellowship should not absolve the inherent myopia underlying any racial litmus test. Well-meaning statements on wanting space to connect over shared struggles sound righteous, until one recognizes the corollary they imply: that engaging with white peers somehow impedes this self-care. Regardless of intent, such exclusionary boundaries in fact widen segregation between groups that desperately need bridging. This undercuts the very mission of diversity, predicated on pluralism as David Brooks argues, not tiered access.
Such selective events may aim to support underrepresented voices, but invariably alienate potential allies like Councilman Baker. This breeds resentment that then undercuts broader equity initiatives essential for progress. And the reactive backlash in response underscores just how charged and fragile tensions around identity remain today.
Minority groups understandably chafe at enduring implicit biases daily, and therefore seek solidarity to commiserate and reaffirm dignity. Yet we must also acknowledge when efforts at corrective support themselves enable prejudice, such as restrictions that exclude anyone who doesn’t share the same marginalized background. We must consider how every action serves to either expand or restrict our unity and the common sphere of belonging.
Though intentions matter, impact counts more. Impact supersedes aim - a truth too easy to ignore when you are the architect of policies that divide. The upshot is that the painful irony of what I like to term “exclusionary inclusivity” simply hands ammunition to critics eager to dismantle diversity programs writ large, willfully oblivious to nuance.
For demagogues like Florida Governor DeSantis, this blunder signals grand hypocrisy, supposedly exposing duplicitous progressives simultaneously preaching and flouting inclusion. Such exaggerated political attacks deliberately conflate convoluted policies such as discriminatory affirmative action with something as benign as a holiday meal for an underrepresented group. But the moral high ground relies on consistency - leaders must unite, not splinter.
In this climate of polarization, leaders in Boston and nationwide must go out of their way to validate and include all those feeling aggrieved, not just historically persecuted groups. Our elected officials, in particular, carry a duty to represent all constituents and heal rifts - not exploit them for electoral gain. I commend Mayor Wu for responsibly acknowledging error, not reflexively defending the event simply because it supported officials of color. But this now demands thoughtful review of unintended harms from well-intentioned affinity group structures. The path forward relies on universal human dignity.
However psychologically comforting exclusive fellowship with those sharing our struggles may feel personally, the collective good requires rising above insular interests. The only antidote to discrimination everywhere is conscientious integration everywhere. Any rhetoric, policy, or action pitting one faction over others only drags America backwards when we desperately need to build common cause.
Martin Luther King, Jr. once ruminated on the irony that Sunday church services were America’s most segregated hour, and he implored faith leaders to reflect on such divides. Similarly, we must ask if an “electeds of color” gathering in a proudly liberal city promoting inclusion aligns with professed values if it deliberately excludes white peers. Moral leadership means taking the hard road, not seeking to be perpetually right. Inclusion starts from within, then radiates outward.
There are no easy answers, but such tone-deaf missteps can still spur progress if met with humility, not hubris. Perhaps this can serve as a teaching moment, prompting Mayor Wu to realign diversity efforts to what unites rather than divides. For example, one could envision a citywide celebration promoting cross-cultural awareness, intentionally integrating officials across all backgrounds. Only by elevating fellowship above ethnicity can Boston truly move towards justice.
I offer this commentary not from supposed moral high ground, but from hard-learned experience grappling with my own blindspots as a DEI advocate focused on mutual understanding. We all carry responsibility to consistently reexamine efforts through an empathetic lens, considering how actions might inadvertently obstruct the path towards equity. Progress relies on perseverance and patience from all.
So I gently encourage the Mayor, colleagues nationwide and myself to press forward growing from this experience with renewed perspective – taking to heart the discomfort Councilman Baker expressed at feeling less-than and deprived of fellowship solely because of racial assumptions. His voice represents multitudes similarly aggrieved, signaling work still unfinished for diversity advocates everywhere.
At times the journey towards a just, equitable America bending towards truth feels Sisyphean, advancement matched by frequent retreats that test morale. But we must hold fast to audacious hope that imperfect beings can build a more perfect union through abiding compassion. Onward."
634b70dd-7d8f-42a8-957c-a8d923b7488d,FDA approves groundbreaking treatment for advanced melanoma,"The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved a new cancer therapy that could one day transform the way a majority of aggressive and advanced tumors are treated.
The treatment, called Amtagvi, from Iovance Biotherapeutics, is for metastatic melanoma patients who have already tried and failed other drugs. It’s known as TIL therapy and involves boosting the number of immune cells inside tumors, harnessing their power to fight the cancer.
It’s the first time a cellular therapy has been approved to treat solid tumors.
“This is going to be huge,” said Dr. Elizabeth Buchbinder, a senior physician at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. Melanoma is “not one of those cancers where there’s like 20 different” possible treatments, she said. “You start running out of options fast.”

Friday’s approval is only for melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, but experts say it holds promise for treating other solid tumors, which account for 90% of all cancers.
“It is our hope that future iterations of TIL therapy will be important for lung cancer, colon cancer, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer and many other cancer types,” said Dr. Patrick Hwu, chief executive of the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida. Moffitt has been involved with Iovance’s clinical trials of TIL therapy.
TIL stands for tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, which are immune cells that exist within tumors. But there are nowhere nearly enough of those cells to effectively fight off cancer cells. TIL therapy involves, in part, extracting some of those immune cells from the patient’s tumor and replicating them billions of times in a lab, then reinfusing them back into the patient.
It’s similar to CAR-T cell therapy, where healthy cells are taken out of a person’s body and then modified in a lab to fight cancers. That’s usually used for hard-to-treat blood cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma. With TIL therapy, the cells used are already programmed to recognize cancer — no lab modifications needed — they just need a boost in numbers to fight it.
Like CAR-T, TIL therapy is a one-time treatment, though the entire process can take up to eight weeks. The TIL cells are first harvested from the tumor through a minimally invasive procedure and then grown and multiplied in the lab, a process that takes 22 days, according to Iovance.
While that’s happening, patients are given chemotherapy to clear out their immune cells to make room for the billions of new melanoma-fighting TIL cells. Once the TIL cells are reinfused back into the body, patients get a drug called interleukin-2 to further stimulate those cells.
Hwu said that most side effects in patients undergoing TIL therapy are not from the reinfusion of cells, but from the chemotherapy and the interleukin-2. These can include nausea and extreme fatigue, and patients are also vulnerable to other illnesses because the body is depleted of disease-fighting white blood cells.
Putting billions of cells back into the body is not entirely risk-free, however, said Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer of the American Cancer Society. It’s possible that the body’s immune system could overreact in what’s known as a cytokine storm, which can cause flu-like symptoms, low blood pressure and organ damage. “There are risks for immune-related side effects, which could be serious,” he said.
Those side effects can be managed, said Dr. Steven Rosenberg, chief of the surgery branch at the National Cancer Institute. “They’re a small price to pay for a growing cancer that would otherwise be be lethal.”
Overall, Dahut said the approval of TIL therapy is “meaningful.”
“What’s nice about this is that patients will receive a wide variety of tumor fighting lymphocytes that will be able to have the capacity to overcome resistance and actually be a living therapy over time, too, to target additional cancer cells should they develop,” Dahut said.
In addition to melanoma, Dahut said that TIL therapy is most likely to be useful in cancers that respond to drugs that “take the brakes off the immune system,” called checkpoint inhibitors.
“Those would be things like non-small cell lung cancer, kidney cancer, maybe bladder cancer, that we know are responsive to immune-based therapies to begin with,” he said. “Many of those patients relapse, so another immune-based therapy that works in a different way, seems to me, the most likely way for this to be effective.”
Much more research is needed, and it may be years before TIL therapy is approved for other types of cancer.
One of Iovance’s clinical trials investigating TIL therapy for non-small cell lung cancer was forced to pause when a participant died. While the death is under investigation, the company said it may have been the result of either chemotherapy or interleukin 2 — therapies meant to knock down each patients’ immune system before they can get the reinfusion of their TIL cells.
The therapy is not expected to work for every metastatic melanoma patient. Clinical trial data that Iovance submitted to the FDA showed that tumors shrank in about a third of patients who received TIL therapy.
Of those patients, about half saw their tumors shrink for at least one year, Dr. Friedrich Graf Finckenstein, chief medical officer of Iovance Biotherapeutics. “Some of these patients even had their tumor completely disappear,” he said.
Another study, conducted in the Netherlands, did a head-to-head analysis of TIL therapy and another form of immunotherapy, called ipilimumab. Twenty percent of the patients who received TIL had complete remissions, compared with 7% of patients who got ipilimumab. Iovance was not involved with the Dutch trial.
The goal of the therapy, Hwu said, “is to get rid of the cancer and have it stay away. These immune cells stay in the body and live in the body for decades.”
The technology has been in development and studied for nearly 40 years. It was Rosenberg who pioneered TIL therapy — first describing how it could shrink melanoma tumors in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1988.
“I’ve been waiting for a very long time to see this given to patients, because I know that it can cure some patients that have metastatic melanoma that cannot be affected by any other treatment,” Rosenberg said.
It’s worked so far for Dan Bennett, 59, of Clermont, Florida. Bennett was diagnosed with melanoma in 2011 after his daughter noticed a suspicious mole on his neck that had changed color.
Despite surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, his cancer kept returning. In 2014, his doctors at Moffitt recommended he try TIL therapy.
“At first, we were pretty leery about it because it was unproven,” Bennett said. Ten years later, Bennett is convinced the TIL therapy is the reason he has survived so long with stage 4 melanoma, which usually has a five-year survival rate of 22.5%.
“I would recommend any experimental drug if it’s your last opportunity,” he said. “You owe it to yourself and your family to do whatever you can to stay alive and to be a productive member of society.”
Buchbinder, the Dana-Faber doctor, was not involved with Iovance’s TIL therapy trial for melanoma, but she is scheduled to begin similar trials with other drugmakers.
“We literally have patients right now waiting for approval because they are hoping they’ll be able to go on it,” Buchbinder said. “It is definitely a practice-changing therapy.”"

The Mountaineers (8-4, 6-3 Big 12 Conference) were out of timeouts when they took over at their own 20-yard line after Isaiah Hankins missed a 32-yard field goal with 1:14 left. They went 80 yards in six plays over 51 seconds, starting with completions of 11 and 23 yards to Hudson Clement.
Richard Reese returned two kickoffs for touchdowns in the first half for Baylor (4-8, 3-6), which then scored 17 consecutive points in the second half to take a 31-27 lead before the missed field goal.
The Bears lost their final five games and have dropped 13 of 16 overall. They finished 1-7 at home, with the only victory while playing a school-record eight home games coming against FCS member Long Island on Sept. 16.
Greene also ran for 103 yards and two touchdowns. White led the Mountaineers with 133 yards rushing on 17 carries.
With Baylor starting quarterback Blake Shapen out with a concussion, Sawyer Robertson completed his first 10 passes and finished 17 for 19 for 219 yards with a 38-yard touchdown pass to Ketron Jackson early in the second half.
Reese's kickoff returns of 96 and 93 yards came in a span of 3:39 in the second quarter. The Mountaineers outgained Baylor 365 total yards to 86 before halftime when they led 27-14.
It was the first time a Baylor player returned back-to-back kickoffs for touchdowns. The Bears hadn't had one since Trestan Ebner's 98-yarder against Iowa State on Sept 25, 2021, a year after his two returns for scores against Kansas — a 100-yard kickoff return and an 83-yard score off the free kick after a safety.
THE TAKEAWAY
West Virginia: The Mountaineers offense was shut down for most of the second half, punting on their first three possessions before being stopped on the fourth. But the Mountaineers came through with their final drive.
Baylor: It would have been easy for the Bears to roll over, with rumors swirling about fourth-year coach Dave Aranda's job status, no hope for a bowl game, and playing in front of a sparse crowd on a rainy night. They continued to fight, but things such as blown coverages that had plagued them all season cost them one more time.
UP NEXT
Baylor's season is over.
West Virginia waits to find out its bowl destination.

If you’ve been dreaming of moving to sun-drenched Italy, now could be the perfect time. The Mediterranean country has plenty of residency and property deals on offer as well as digital nomad schemes.
For the best chance of securing a work permit, consider looking for employment in one of the sectors undergoing a labor crisis in Italy. And if you’re worried about the notoriously complex Italian bureaucracy, you’ll be glad to hear the government is taking pains to simplify the process of applying for a work visa.
Jobs Most Likely To Get You A Work Permit In Italy
According to the European Labour Authority (EURES), several industries in Italy are seriously short on workers. Between 2023 and 2027, sectors including healthcare, technology and hospitality offer the best chance of employment. Each year, the government also releases the official work permit quota for foreign workers. For 2024, 151,000 job positions are available.
If you fancy moving to Italy, these are nine occupations most likely to secure you a work permit:
Doctor
Nurse
Physiotherapist
Healthcare and social services professional
Restaurant worker
Mathematics and computer science specialist
ICT technician
Engineer
Skilled construction worker
How Do You Apply For An Italian Work Permit?
Non-EU citizens looking to relocate to Italy need to begin by applying for a work visa. This generally requires securing a position with an Italian employer who then files the paperwork for the permit on behalf of the employee.
Once the permit has been granted, the employee can apply for a work visa at their nearest Italian consulate or embassy in their home country. Remember, this only allows entry into Italy. Upon relocation, the individual must convert the work visa into a residence permit, or permesso di soggiorno, which grants permission to live and work legally in the country. This must be done within eight days of entering Italy.
The application process is set to become simpler in 2024 as the Italian government has vowed to reduce paperwork and bureaucracy. The system should become more efficient as authorities introduce faster processing times and minimized waiting periods. On arrival in Italy, you can expect assistance programs to help you find housing, schools and other essential services."

It’s Tim Tszyu.
Not Kostya Tszyu’s son.
Not that Tszyu doesn’t look up to his legendary world champion father as an idol, but he’s steadfast that at this point, he’s done enough to make his own mark — and name — in boxing.
Tim Tszyu is confident he’s made his own mark in boxing beyond his father’s shadow. Getty Images
Tszyu (22-0), 28, has long emerged as the top super welterweight contender, and now is currently WBO interim champion.
He’s become a celebrity in his hometown Australia, where he’s fought in front of raucous, sold-out arenas with fans chanting his name.
They were shouting it as loud as they ever have during his TKO victory over Tony Harrison on March 12 at Quods Bank Arena in Sydney, when Tszyu became the interim champion.
Maybe that’s why Tszyu felt it was the time to so distinctly – and pointedly — ask the crowd “What’s my name?” repeatedly during his in-ring interview following the win.
“I think from the first-ever fight I ever fought, people have been saying the same exact thing,” Tszyu told The Post. “‘You’re only here because of your last name.’ For me, saying ‘What’s my name?’ is to remind everyone that it’s not my last name that’s got me here, it’s my first name.
“Yeah, 100 percent [I established that]. I beat the man who beat the man. That’s all there was.”
But Harrison wasn’t necessarily the opponent Tszyu had wanted, nor deserved.

After his 2022 unanimous decision victory over Terrell Gausha in his United States debut, Tszyu had earned the right to challenge the division’s undisputed champion, Jermell Charlo.
But a broken hand led to Charlo postponing the bout, forcing Tszyu to pivot to Harrison, who was the only fighter to ever defeat Charlo (although Charlo later found revenge in a rematch) as the next best option.
It also opened the door for his interim title, as Charlo still owns the full WBO title along with the three other belts in the division.
After dispatching Harrison, Tszyu again earned the right to face Charlo, whom he directly called out after the fight.
Charlo — while serving as a guest commentator on Showtime’s broadcast of the Tszyu-Harrison fight — told The Post that he was looking forward to fighting Tszyu because “he’s perfect for my style.”
But their planned summer bout was again called off, as Charlo continues to rehab his injury.
For the second time, Tszyu had to pivot, and instead is fighting 27-year-old veteran Carlos Ocampo (34-2) to defend his WBO interim 154-pound title as the main event on Showtime’s card on Saturday night at the Gold Coast and Exhibition Centre in Broadbeach, Queensland, Australia.
“At first, when I first got told [Charlo] couldn’t fight for another, like, six months, I was pretty frustrated,” Tszyu said. “Now I’m like whatever, I’ve got another opponent in front of me. My head is in the game. It’s all right. The show goes on, as they say.
“As you play a video game, there’s the big boss, then there’s little bosses that you’ve got to beat before the big boss. And that’s what it feels like for me. If I can’t do this guy, then I go for the next one. Whatever, the road to undisputed continues for me.”

It’s a challenge Tszyu has now been forced to get used to — focusing on new opponents while keeping the undisputed Charo bout, which he’s now earned twice, in the back of his mind.
But perhaps the delays have delivered somewhat of a silver lining, as Tszyu described his win over Harrison as “my most patient one. My most comfortable one, for the moment.”
And he has another chance to fine-tune parts of his game on Saturday, before the he hopefully again tries for the fight he’s for so long had his eyes on.
Or more specifically, the opponent.

“You know what? For me, it’s not about the belts,” Tszyu said. “It’s just about beating Charlo. It doesn’t matter. Let’s say he vacates all the belts. I still want Charlo. That’s the name, that’s the top dog, I don’t want dogs to define me, it’s the names and the resume that you have behind you that describes your journey.”"

“I’m a bit anxious that this rally can continue,” he said in an interview on CNBC. “I like to believe that this rally has legs. I’m a bit anxious. We’re sort of in the seventh or eighth inning of this rally, but part of it has been the soft landing story.”

The S&P 500 stock index is up 16.8% this year, in a rally mainly driven by optimism around artificial intelligence.
Griffin said the Federal Reserve is likely close to the end of the interest rate hiking cycle in its battle to tame inflation. “There’s a small chance of one more increase later this year,” he said.

Still, he said it is unclear when Fed chair Jerome Powell will be able to cut rates because of some ongoing stimulus measures.
“He’s showing up in a fight with both of his hands tied behind his back because DC is just on a different agenda than he is,” Citadel’s founder said. “He’s trying to prudently slow the economy, bring inflation back down and really engineer the whole soft landing.”
Gasoline prices are also a concern to inflation, as prices have risen.

Griffin considered it is unlikely that inflation will come down to the Fed’s 2% target. “It only will be at 2% if the economy is in a real recession.”
Citadel, which invests $61 billion for clients, became the most successful hedge fund of all time last year when it earned $16 billion."

A toxicology report later revealed seven different surgical drugs were found in her system. Was it murder or a terrible accident? The evidence presented at Joel Pellot's trial for the murder of his wife tells a different story from what he told police happened the day Muñoz died.
Sept. 22, 2020
Maria Muñoz Facebook
Muñoz, 31, a stay-at-home mother, lived in Laredo, Texas, with her two young sons and her husband, Pellot. On Sept. 22, 2020, Pellot called 911 saying Muñoz may have taken some prescription pills and was not breathing. First responders tried to save her but after failed attempts, Muñoz was declared dead at 3:58 a.m. that day. The first officer on the scene, Gregorio De La Cruz, told ""48 Hours"" that Pellot's behavior seemed suspicious and certain aspects about the scene didn't quite make sense.

When Officer De La Cruz from the Laredo Police Department responded to the 911 call, his bodycam was recording. Pellot, a nurse anesthetist, is seen dressed in teal surgical scrubs. The video captured some key moments that made De La Cruz suspect that Pellot may have had something to do with his wife's death.
The pill container
Joel Pellot had told police Maria Muñoz may have overdosed on the drug clonazepam, but when the autopsy was conducted — eight hours after she was declared dead — the medical examiner found no pill residue in her stomach. Webb County District Attorney's Office
One of those key moments was when De La Cruz asked for the pills Pellot said Muñoz had taken. Pellot went to the bathroom and De La Cruz says he heard him pull a container from the medicine cabinet. De La Cruz thought it was odd because in his experience when someone overdoses on drugs, they are usually found near the person. In this case, the clonazepam pills prescribed to Pellot, were in another room.
Later, Pellot is seen on camera grabbing the pill container from the floor and putting it in his pocket. De La Cruz wondered, why would he take the pills back? Was he hiding something?

In addition to Pellot putting the pills in his pocket, there was something about his appearance that De La Cruz said seemed suspicious. De La Cruz observed Pellot sweating profusely through his scrubs, and De La Cruz said he seemed like he may have been under the influence of drugs.
Evidence at the scene
A needle catheter, the kind used for IVs, was discovered on the carpeted staircase. Webb County District Attorney's Office
De La Cruz also found a needle catheter on the stairs at the couple's home. This didn't make much sense to him. Pellot and Muñoz had two young children — why would there be a needle on the stairs?
A medical bag

In addition to the needle, first responders also found syringes and IV equipment in a medical bag at the home. Although Pellot was a nurse anesthetist who worked in operating rooms, these types of supplies are normally found in a medical setting.
Police interview Joel Pellot
Cameras recorded Joel Pellot in the police interview room. While he was alone, ""he's hitting walls, he's moving furniture … It was scaring some of the people down the hall in the dispatch room,"" said Sgt. Luis Mata. Laredo Police Department
Authorities put Pellot in the back of a cruiser and drove him to the police station for an interview. The cameras captured him crying, screaming, and pushing furniture around in the interview room.
During this interview, Pellot told lead investigator Sgt. Luis Mata that he had moved out of the house and was living with his girlfriend and that he went to see Muñoz to talk about their marriage. Pellot told Mata that his wife took the clonazepam pills at some point after they talked, and the medical supplies found at the home were his. Pellot said he was taking steroids.
An unexplained pinprick mark
What investigators found particularly suspicious was a pinprick mark on Maria Muñoz's right elbow crease, the type someone would get after getting an IV. Webb County District Attorney's Office
What Pellot couldn't explain was a red mark on Muñoz's right elbow crease. This mark, along with phone calls from concerned friends, family, and colleagues of Pellot telling Mata that Pellot may have killed Maria, is what led him to request a toxicology screening.
Maria Muñoz's own words
Maria Muñoz's journal Webb County District Attorney's Office
Investigators found a series of journals Muñoz used to write about what was happening in her life. Through her writings, they discovered Muñoz loved her husband and wanted to keep her family together, but accepted that he wanted to be with someone else.
The medical examiner also looked at the journals and determined Muñoz's death was not a suicide.
Maria Muñoz's cellphone recordings

Muñoz secretly recorded a conversation on her cellphone that provided a glimpse on how Pellot was treating her. In the cellphone video, Muñoz is heard asking her husband what he wanted out of their marriage. She was trying to keep her family together, but Pellot didn't seem interested in having that conversation.
""Pray for me""
The day before Maria Muñoz died, she planned to meet with Joel Pellot to discuss their future. She texted a friend: ""I just ask if you can pray for me ... Tonight we are going to talk …"" Webb County District Attorney's Office
The day before she died, Muñoz told her friend, Yazmin Martinez, that she and Pellot were going to have a ""heart to heart"" conversation that night. Muñoz asked Martinez to pray for her, but not because she suspected her husband was capable of killing her. Martinez said all Muñoz was hoping for was an honest conversation with him.
A bombshell toxicology report
The toxicology report showed no clonazepam — the drug Joel Pellot claimed Maria Muñoz had taken — in her system. It revealed seven other drugs in her system, most of them typically used during surgery and one of them can only be administered with an IV. Webb County District Attorney's Office
In January 2021, Mata and De La Cruz finally got the toxicology test results they had been waiting for. There was no clonazepam, the drug Pellot claimed Muñoz had taken. But there were seven other drugs in Muñoz's system: morphine, Demerol, Versed, Propofol, ketamine, lidocaine, and Narcan. Most of them are typically used during surgery.

District Attorney Isidro Alaniz selected a team of attorneys to represent Muñoz: Karina Rios, Ana Karen Garza Gutierrez, Marisela Jacaman, and Cristal Calderon. Based on the evidence collected at the scene, the extensive writings in Muñoz's journals, interviews with friends, and expert accounts, they were convinced Pellot killed his wife.

“I strayed on my wife, and it’s devastating to her and not a very pretty picture,” he told USA Today in a story published Monday. “What it isn’t is a crime.”
Two women came forward to accuse him in December 2021, days after the “Sex and the City” spinoff “And Just Like That” premiered on Max. Three other women also alleged assault.
Noth, who played Mr. Big on “SATC” and briefly starred in “AJLT,” denied the accusations as “categorically false” in 2021 and called the incidents consensual. No criminal charges have been filed.
“You give yourself the same excuses that many men do; it’s just a little side dance, and it’s fun,” he told USA Today. “You’re not hurting anybody. No one’s going to know about this, you know, and sex is just enjoyable. And suddenly, a lot of people want to have sex with you. It’s like, ‘Well, I’m not going to get this chance again.'”

Noth acknowledged that he could face civil lawsuits, calling it “a money train for a lot of people.”
“There’s nothing I can say to change anyone’s mind when you have that kind of a tidal wave,” he said.
“It sounds defensive. I’m not. There’s no criminal court. There’s no criminal trial. There’s nothing for me to get on the stand about and get my story out, get witnesses. And there’s even more absurd add-ons that are completely ridiculous, that have absolutely no basis in fact. And I don’t like talking about it because as soon as I do, you’ll get the Daily Mail or someone grabbing a part of it and doing it, and I don’t want my kids seeing that.”
Noth shares two sons, Orion, 15, and Keats, 3, with Wilson, 41. The couple wed in 2012.

The Post reached out to Noth’s spokespeople for comment, as well as reps for “AJLT” showrunner Michael Patrick King. A rep for Sarah Jessica Parker declined to comment.
Parker, 58, and co-stars Cynthia Nixon, 57, and Kristin Davis, 58, issued a statement shortly after the allegations surfaced in 2021.
“We are deeply saddened to hear the allegations against Chris Noth,” their statement read. “We support the women who have come forward and shared their painful experiences. We know it must be a very difficult thing to do and we commend them for it.”
Following the accusations, Noth was axed from the “AJLT” Season 1 finale last year, lost a $12 million deal for his tequila brand, was fired from the CBS drama “The Equalizer,” had a Peloton ad pulled and was dropped by his agency.
“I’m not going to lay down and just say it’s over,” he told USA Today. “It’s a salacious story, but it’s just not a true one. And I can’t just say, ‘Well, OK, that’s it for me’ because of that. I’m an actor. I have other things that I want to do creatively. And I have children to support.”

92262797-a8f2-4e7c-8293-3d0b4e5799ed,Hunter Biden pleads not guilty at arraignment on felony gun charges,"The son of President Joe Biden pleaded not guilty Tuesday to three felony gun charges, after a deal that included a diversion in connection with a firearms charge and a guilty plea to two misdemeanor tax charges collapsed in court over the summer.
The hearing got underway around 10 a.m., with Hunter Biden entering the courthouse around 9:45 a.m.
The conditions of his release remain similar to what was imposed in July. Of note, the judge said that since that hearing in July, Hunter has been ""communicative with and responsive"" to the probation office in California. He has also been drug tested a number of times and they have all come back negative. Drug testing remains part of his conditions of release.
If convicted on all three charges, Hunter Biden faces a maximum of 25 years in prison and up to $750,000 in fines.
The next court date has not yet been assigned, but there is a pretrial motion deadline of Nov. 3.
Hunter Biden's attorney Abbe Lowell said they plan to file a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the diversion agreement is still valid. Lowell also said they will seek a dismissal that one of the statutes he is charged with violating — a ban on gun possession for drug users — is unconstitutional.
The argument hinged on a new framework laid out by the Supreme Court last year in a closely watched decision that expanded gun rights. In its ruling, the court's conservative majority said gun restrictions must be consistent with the ""nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.""

In the wake of the high court's ruling, scores of longstanding gun laws have faced fresh scrutiny, and Abbe Lowell, Hunter Biden's lawyer, has publicly suggested he believes the law banning drug users from having guns is unconstitutional, as some federal courts have found.
The charges against Hunter Biden stem from his possession of a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver in October 2018, which prosecutors previously said he unlawfully possessed for 11 days after lying on the firearm registration form about his drug use. One count alleges Hunter Biden provided a false written statement about his drug use on the form used for firearms purchases, and the second count is for allegedly giving a false statement to the dealer to keep for its records, as required by the federal government. The third count is for allegedly possessing a firearm while he was a known drug user.
If convicted on all charges, Hunter Biden could face a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison and fines of up to $750,000.
In response to the indictment, Lowell said his client ""was not a threat to public safety"" when he possessed the unloaded gun and said of special counsel David Weiss that his ""bending to political pressure presents a grave threat to our system of justice.""
""We believe these charges are barred by the agreement the prosecutors made with Mr. Biden, the recent rulings by several federal courts that this statute is unconstitutional, and the facts that he did not violate that law, and we plan to demonstrate all of that in court,"" he continued.
The charges are the first brought by Weiss in his investigation into Hunter Biden since he was appointed special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland last month. Other potential charges, including the tax counts Hunter Biden had previously intended to plead guilty to, could still be brought against the president's son.
For now at least, if the case goes to trial, it could take place in the midst of Joe Biden's 2024 reelection campaign.
A looming court fight over historical tradition
Though the case against Hunter Biden is in its early stages, questions have arisen about the constitutionality of the law cited in the indictment against him on the possession charge.
In the wake of the June 2022 Supreme Court decision that laid out a new standard for determining whether firearms restrictions comport with the Constitution, some U.S. district courts have found the drug-user provision does not withstand Second Amendment scrutiny because those courts said the government failed to show how it is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of gun regulation.
""The current landscape with regard to this unlawful user prohibition is somewhat unclear,"" Andrew Willinger, executive director of the Duke Center for Firearms Law, told CBS News, though he noted that most district courts have upheld the law.
But in August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit found the drug-user statute to be unconstitutional as applied to a Texas man, Patrick Daniels, who admitted to regularly using marijuana. In its decision, the three-judge panel acknowledged that while the nation's history and tradition ""may support some limits on an intoxicated person's right to carry a weapon,"" it doesn't ""justify disarming a sober citizen based exclusively on his past drug usage.""
Keith Rosen, a former federal prosecutor, said an issue for the prosecutors in the case involving Hunter Biden could be establishing that he was actively using drugs in the 11-day span he had the revolver.
""I think this is going to be an important question that the defense is going to raise as they litigate this case. I suspect they'll argue, just like in Daniels, that it may be true that Hunter was using drugs during this period of time when he got the gun, but unless the government can prove that he was high at the time that he physically had the gun then they can't prevail,"" Rosen said. ""I think the government will resist that. Historically, courts would not have required the government to prove that somebody was high at the specific time that they were holding the weapon, but in light of Daniels I think that's going to be a live issue in this case.""
Willinger said there is ""interesting interplay"" between the illegal possession charge and the other two in the indictment related to the alleged false statements.
""It does seem like the lying charges may rise and fall with the [possession] charge because if it turns out that a court says [the measure] is unconstitutional as applied to Biden, then the sale would not have been unlawful,"" he said.
The charges against Hunter Biden were brought in federal district court in Delaware, where appeals are heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit. That court has been asked to review a Pennsylvania man's conviction on three counts of possession of a firearm by an unlawful drug user, who argues the law doesn't pass constitutional muster.
The Biden administration has urged courts to uphold the statute, pointing to founding-era laws that disarmed intoxicated people, people struggling with mental illness and those deemed dangerous to public peace or safety. Willinger predicted the Justice Department would maintain that position in the case involving Hunter Biden.
""It seems to me a little more of an obvious case to take on appeal and to push hard for constitutionality here from the government's perspective because it's not dealing with marijuana, where you have legalization at the state level. It's dealing with a different controlled substance,"" Willinger said.
The White House has declined to comment on the case involving the president's son, directing questions to the Justice Department.
While the Supreme Court's decision last year in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen, now known simply as Bruen, has threatened decades-old gun laws, the justices will have the chance to clarify their historical tradition test with a case they will hear Nov. 7.
That dispute involves the 30-year-old law prohibiting people under domestic violence restraining orders from having guns, which the 5th Circuit concluded was unconstitutional because the government failed to meet its burden of showing it's consistent with the nation's historical tradition of gun regulation.
The Justice Department could also ask the high court to review a 3rd Circuit decision that struck down a law banning felons from having guns.
""The combination of those two cases might shed some light on how the court believes that this new test applies in this prohibited-persons category,"" Willinger said.
He noted that the court could adopt a view expressed by Justice Amy Coney Barrett when she was a federal appeals court judge, in which she concluded that history shows that legislatures have the power to bar dangerous people from possessing guns.
""If the court really embraces that dangerousness principle, then I think it has potentially major consequences for the felon ban and also potentially for these other provisions like,"" the prohibition on unlawful drug users, Willinger said.
Still, he said it would be ""pretty startling"" for the Supreme Court to strike down the drug-user provision on its face.
""I find that to be unlikely, especially when you start to think about some of the controlled substances that might be sort of reality-altering drugs. I don't see the Supreme Court or really a majority of circuit courts reaching that outcome,"" he said.
Second Amendment groups respond
Though Hunter Biden could join those challenging the constitutionality of gun laws under the conservative Supreme Court's new framework, pro-Second Amendment groups are not jumping to his defense.
Gun Owners for America said after Hunter Biden's indictment that it ""opposes all gun control, but so long as this President continues to use every tool at his disposal to harass and criminalize guns, gun owners and gun dealers, his son should be receiving the same treatment and scrutiny as all of us.""
National Rifle Association spokesman Billy McLaughlin told CBS News that ""laws should be applied equally against all criminals.""
The group added, ""The United States Supreme Court has ruled that federal law prohibits 'knowingly mak[ing] any false statement or representation with respect to the information required by this chapter to be kept in the records' of a federally licensed gun dealer.' The Bruen ruling does not address this matter."""

The Brazilian Amazon continues to grapple with a severe drought. Experts say the most likely cause of the deaths in the lakes were high water temperatures, as temperatures have exceeded 102 degrees Fahrenheit in the Tefe Lake region.
The Mamiraua Institute, a research group of Brazil’s Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, said additional dolphins were found Monday. Local media has reported thousands of fish have also died at Tefe Lake, which is key for mammals and fish in the area. Video provided by the institute showed dolphin carcasses beached on the lakeside.
""In one week we have already lost around 120 animals between the two of them, which could represent 5% to 10% of the population,"" said Miriam Marmontel, a researcher from the Mamiraua Institute.

The drought is not just impacting the region’s wildlife as humans have been unable to travel or deliver supplies to some isolated areas as the waterways are the main method of transportation.
Nicson Marreira, mayor of Tefe, a city of 60,000 residents, said his government was impacted because of the dry rivers.
""Many communities are becoming isolated, without access to good quality water, without access to the river, which is their main means of transportation,"" Fleischmann said.
Teams of veterinarians and aquatic mammal experts are investigating the deaths, the Brazilian government’s Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation, which manages conservation areas, said last week.

1e53328e-d169-4908-8bcf-81a6b1e532f4,"Republicans Waste $167M in Losing Effort to Defeat Trump in NH, IA","Republican presidential contenders spent over $167 million in losing efforts to defeat former President Donald Trump in New Hampshire and Iowa, with plans to spend millions more in future primaries.
The massive amount of money spent in the first two primaries of the 2024 cycle shows how strong former President Donald Trump’s grassroots support is around the nation. Trump spent just $34.1 million in both states.
The large sum of money also reveals the number of resources the Republican Party did not spend on defeating President Joe Biden.
“Campaign officials are concerned that if Haley does not drop out after New Hampshire, it would force them to spend resources against her in South Carolina for the next three weeks instead of turning to states where Trump is politically vulnerable,” according to CNN.
Below are the campaigns and outside group ad spending for Republican primary candidates in New Hampshire, CNN calculated:
Pro-Haley: $31 million
Pro-Trump: $15.8 million
Other: $31 million
In Iowa, Haley spent two million more than Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) — the most out of any candidate. Both amounted to more than half the total $123 million in ads between the Republican candidates since Monday, CNN reported:
Pro-Haley: $37 million
Pro-DeSantis: $35 million
Pro-Trump: $18.3 million
All others: $33.2 million
Moving forward to Nevada and South Carolina, Republican campaigns and PACs spent more than $123 million, CNN reported:
In Nevada, none of the campaigns or outside groups are on the air. Haley’s campaign is not competing in the state’s party-run caucuses on February 8, opting instead for the state-run primary on February 6. But only the caucuses will be used to determine the allocation of delegates to this summer’s Republican convention. And in South Carolina, the next major contest on February 24, just one group is actively spending: Americans for Prosperity Action, the super PAC arm of the Koch family’s political network, which is backing Haley.
Trump leads by no less than 30 points in every state after the New Hampshire primary.

Driving the news: On early Friday, the prosecutor reviewing the Jan. 18 raid said the Georgia State Patrol troopers who shot and killed Manuel Paez ""Tortuguita"" Terán won't face criminal charges.
""The use of lethal (deadly) force by the Georgia State Patrol was objectively reasonable under the circumstances in this case,"" George R. Christian, the district attorney pro tempore for the Stone Mountain Judicial Circuit, said in a statement accompanying the release of a 31-page report on the investigation.
In the weeds: The Prosecuting Attorneys Council of Georgia appointed Christian after DeKalb County District Attorney Sherry Boston withdrew from the case after the raid over disagreements with Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr.
Catch up quick: Law enforcement officials won't release records or comment on the case ""until such time as the above investigation and prosecution is not pending,"" Christian said.
Details: Terán's family, who is suing the city for records related to the case, called the DA's decision not to pursue criminal charges a ""disappointment"" and demanded the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to turn over its photographs, witness interviews and other evidence.
What they're saying: ""We were told that once the DA's report was released, the GBI would release all of the underlying evidence,"" Jeff Filipovits, one of the family's attorneys, told Axios in a statement.
""But now, the district attorney has stated that his office will not produce the underlying evidence.""
Of note: Terán, who according to activists identified as nonbinary and used they/them pronouns, is referred to as ""he"" in the report."

96c5ff06-0311-4ed6-80c1-72c5d6480ee0,FDA fast-tracking approval of new drugs,"The Food and Drug Administration is now regularly approving new drugs after just one or two clinical trials — a significant departure from the more rigorous vetting process the agency was previously known for, newly published research reveals.
Furthermore, the authors say, there’s now less information available to the public about the results of all trials.
Of the 37 drugs approved by the FDA last year, 24 (about 65%) were approved based on just one study, according to a paper published in JAMA Network Open.
Only four of those 37 drugs, or about 11%, reported three or more studies before approval.
“Everything is supposed to be transparent with this FDA process,” Veronica Irvin, an associate professor at Oregon State University’s College of Health, said in a news release.
The FDA is facing criticism over its decisions to fast-track the approval of certain drugs, using limited data from fewer clinical trials. REUTERS
“The purpose of ClinicalTrials.gov was to have a way for the non-scientific community to access the trials and their results, in a way that people can understand,” she said.
Researchers agree that it’s critical to minimize delays in making drugs for serious diseases like cancer available to patients, but these findings highlight a need for greater transparency around how drugs get approved.
For example, many drugs have been tested in multiple clinical trials, but drug companies are only required to share the results from two of those trials, leaving questions about why they selected those two trials for submission — and what happened during the other trials.
“We’re not saying that cancer drugs need a lot more studies; just that they should show all the results or trials that are completed,” said Irvin, a co-author of the paper.
“It doesn’t mean they wouldn’t get approved, but it means we’d have a more complete picture,” she added.
Another piece of new research, published in Health Affairs Scholar, found that of the 46 new drugs approved in 2017, 19 of them (41%) were approved based on a single study — though the drugmakers conducted an average of 2.2 studies per drug, including 165 studies for the popular weight-loss drug Ozempic.
The ease with which novel drugs are approved is in part the result of the 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016 to speed the approval of new medicines so patients could gain access to life-saving treatments.
Some critics charge that Aduhelm was approved with limited data and an “atypical collaboration” with drugmaker Biogen. AP
As part of that law, the FDA relaxed some standards to allow treatments for priority health conditions such as cancer to be approved with fewer supporting studies, and with less emphasis on randomized clinical trials.
But in the years following the passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, the FDA has faced a firestorm of criticism over the approval process for some new drugs.
Last year, a congressional investigation found that the FDA’s “atypical collaboration” with drugmaker Biogen to approve Aduhelm, a high-priced Alzheimer’s drug, was “rife with irregularities.”
And a drug for treating agitation in people with Alzheimer’s disease, brexpiprazole (Rexulti), was granted fast-track approval by the FDA in May.
But a damning report in BMJ revealed that brexpiprazole failed to provide a clinically meaningful benefit even as it increased the risk of death among patients.
Nonetheless, the FDA fast-tracked its approval, and the drug’s manufacturers (Otsuka and Lundbeck) predict $1 billion in annual sales.
“We are very disappointed that the FDA approved this additional label indication for brexpiprazole on such weak data,” Nina Zeldes, health researcher at the consumer advocacy organisation Public Citizen, told BMJ.
“The FDA has set a dangerous precedent about the data it may require for future drug approvals for this vulnerable patient group,” Zeldes added.
When the FDA states that it has reviewed drugmakers’ two submitted studies, Irvin noted, the public is missing information about how many other studies were conducted, what those studies showed and why only those specific two studies were chosen for evaluation.
“We want doctors and patients to be able to see the whole picture,” she said."
75020258-15ea-48d2-93c8-ac2ca8cad414,"Knock down a few, build one: in NSW that counts as a gain for councils’ housing targets","Luxury homes built on the site of former unit blocks in Sydney are counting towards council targets for new dwellings, even where they have reduced the available housing stock by displacing multiple properties.
A swathe of interwar apartment buildings in Sydney’s eastern suburbs and inner city face the wrecking ball, to be replaced with modern residences, as Guardian Australia revealed on Wednesday.
Now housing advocates have called for the federal and state governments to stop relying on Australian Bureau of Statistics data that only counts gross dwelling approvals for their housing metrics.
The managing director of the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute, Michael Fotheringham, said it was difficult to hold housing targets to account if developments were being counted as a gain when they actually represented a net loss of properties.
“We need to have better tracking,” Fotheringham said. “In a sense, additions in housing stock are meaningless if you don’t factor in subtractions.
“It’s as though knocking down an [apartment] building and building a house there is the same as building that house on a greenfield site.
“We’re just not doing the maths properly.”
The head of planning and housing policy at the Committee for Sydney, Estelle Grech, said the city was “effectively going backward”, and needed to use housing figures that could measure and identify the trend.
“It’s such a problem because it’s going to reduce the diversity of communities, and make wealthy enclaves even less accessible,” she said.
“Given we’ve got targets to build these kinds of dwellings, we can’t afford to go backward. There’s this assumption that urban renewal always results in an increase in dwellings – you would never imagine you’d be reducing it.”
Grech pointed to a recent New South Wales Productivity Commission report that found infrastructure-related costs of housing developments in western Sydney were up to $75,000 higher per home than developments in more central suburbs.
Several inner city and eastern Sydney councils have passed motions to include “no net dwelling loss” provisions in their planning guidelines, in a bid to protect some of the few relatively affordable properties in their generally affluent suburbs.
Grech said the trend of demolishing unit blocks to build a smaller number of homes appeared to be confined to just a handful of areas and should ideally be dealt with by councils, but “there’s the opportunity for the state government to come in if some councils aren’t willing to”.
“By default these buildings have become the cheaper, grittier, relatively affordable housing in these areas,” she said. “If we lose them that’s a huge problem.”
Since publication of Wednesday’s story, Guardian Australia has been notified of several more cases, including two unit blocks in North Bondi – one of which was built in 2019 – due to be turned into a single luxury dwelling.
Among the other buildings under threat is a 1928 two-storey block in Bellevue Hill containing eight small apartments, which is set to be demolished after Woollahra council approved a controversial application for a new development of three units.

Another is a block of four apartments in Tamarama – part of neighbouring Waverley council – which was recently sold following marketing that it had development approval to turn it into a single luxury residence.
On Wylde Street in Potts Point, two adjacent three-storey blocks comprising 20 units may go in favour of five luxury apartments.
The mayor of Waverley, Paula Massellos, said the trend was claiming about 30 dwellings each year in her council area.
“What’s left of our affordable housing stock comprised of older, smaller units is being snapped up by developers and is being replaced with large luxury apartments or houses that do not cater to the diverse housing needs of our community,” she said.
The Greens housing spokesperson, Jenny Leong, said losing inner city dwellings was “the last thing we need to be doing”, especially if it was “to deliver more luxury, elite homes for the mega rich”.
“Councils and the state government have a role to play to make sure that we’re not losing studio apartments, smaller units in our city that are affordable.
Justin Simon, from Sydney Yimby, said housing targets should reflect net dwelling increases.
He noted that many of the buildings targeted as part of the trend would be illegal to build now given parking requirements and zoning rules.
“There’s been a massive decline in the construction of these two- and three-level buildings,” he said.
A spokesperson for the state planning department said it was up to councils to increase housing supply elsewhere in the LGA if they approved a reduction.
“We all have a shared responsibility across all levels of government to deliver more housing supply overall and are working with Sydney councils to deliver a fairer distribution of more diverse, well-located housing where people want to live and work,” they said.
The department pointed to powers that all councils in Sydney have to impose a levy on developments that result in a loss of affordable and low-cost housing.
The Minns government is undertaking an audit of all government-owned land to see what could be developed into housing, including social housing."
0b38a117-687d-49b0-a597-c95538021316,Zaha poised to reject £30m-a-year Saudi Arabia offer but Modric may move there,"Wilfried Zaha looks set to reject an offer worth a staggering £30m a year to join Cristiano Ronaldo at Al-Nassr but Luka Modric is considering a move to the Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal after more than a decade at Real Madrid.
Zaha, who will be a free agent when his contract with Crystal Palace expires at the end of the month, held more talks with Al-Nassr last week as they attempt to improve their squad after missing out on the Saudi title to Al-Ittihad. The 30-year-old is being offered a two-year contract worth about three times the £200,000 a week on the table from Palace, but it is understood he would prefer to stay in Europe. He has attracted interest from Paris Saint-Germain in recent days.
The French champions are yet to submit an offer to the Ivory Coast international but informal talks with his representatives are believed to have taken place. Reports in France on Sunday claimed that PSG’s football adviser Luis Campos was an admirer of Zaha’s “game changing” ability. Marseille are also believed to be interested.
Zaha missed the end of the Premier League season with a hamstring injury but is understood to be almost back to full fitness. The four-year offer from Palace would make him by far the highest-paid player in the club’s history. It remains to be seen whether Zaha will remain at Palace, who are yet to confirm whether Roy Hodgson will be offered another year in charge after steering them to safety.
Modric, who joined Madrid from Tottenham in 2012 for £30m and has won the Champions League five times, had looked set to agree a year’s extension to his contract. It is understood the Croatia midfielder is Al-Hilal’s main target after they missed out on Lionel Messi. He is expected to be offered a two-year deal worth about £60m a season.
Steven Gerrard is considering an offer to become coach of Al-Ettifaq after being sacked by Aston Villa in October. The 43-year-old is expected to fly to Saudi Arabia this week for further talks with the club that finished seventh in the Saudi Pro League, which will expand to 18 teams next season.

The Saudi sovereign wealth fund which owns Newcastle, the Public Investment Fund, is taking 75% stakes in four of the country’s clubs: Al-Nassr, Al-Hilal, Al-Ahli and Al-Ittihad.

Tottenham’s Hugo Lloris, Manchester City’s Riyad Mahrez and Roberto Firmino – who is out of contract with Liverpool – are among the other star names targeted by Saudi clubs."
3445398d-2ce2-4821-b5c9-d2c8d599f7ad,"Americans increasingly see border as crisis, call for tougher measures, CBS News poll finds","Americans are increasingly concerned about the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border, and the percentage who think the Biden administration should be tougher on immigrants trying to cross it is up to the highest percentage yet.
Most say the border situation is very serious, and nearly half now say it's a crisis — up from May — a change in sentiment driven primarily by Democrats and independents.
As a result, President Biden's approval on handing the U.S.-Mexico border has also dropped, and his approval on handling immigration in general is at an all-time low, though it hasn't dragged down his overall approval rating.
Support for transporting migrants to northern cities has also dipped — among Democrats and Republicans — and now, most Americans disapprove of the practice.
Americans show concern across partisan lines about resources and the ability of the U.S. to handle more people. But while Democrats express more concern about the lives and well being of the migrants, Republicans express more concern about national security.
Many Americans, particularly those living in cities, report an increase in the number of immigrants arriving in their local area, and those who do are the most likely to view the situation as a crisis.
Meanwhile, the practice of southern border states sending migrants to northern cities and states is facing increasing disapproval — particularly in the Northeast. In May, the country was evenly divided on this, but now a majority disapprove. Approval is down even among Republicans, about half of whom now disapprove of the practice. Some of this difference is regional: most Republicans in the southern and western states from where the migrants are being sent approve, while most Republicans in the Midwest and Northeast — where the migrants are being sent — disapprove.
Most Americans also oppose providing temporary housing and social services for migrants in the areas where they live. In May, a slim majority approved of this. Approval is down slightly among all partisans, as well as among those who live in urban and suburban areas, though a large majority of Democrats, and most Americans who live in cities, still favor it.
While Americans overwhelmingly think asylum-seekers crossing the U.S.-Mexico border should get a hearing, most don't want them to remain in the United States. A majority says these applicants should leave the U.S., including some who think they should have no opportunity to come back.
Still, most Americans want the U.S. to focus on making sure the process of determining who should be admitted is more efficient, rather than focus on keeping migrants from crossing the border in the first place. Those who think that the influx is driven more by conditions in the home countries of the migrants lean toward making the asylum system more efficient, while those who think it's driven more by insufficient border security and the decisions of the Biden administration are more intent on keeping the migrants out in the first place. This, in turn, is connected to partisanship.
What do Americans think is causing the current surge in migrants at the border? This, too, is largely tied to political beliefs: most Democrats cite increased dangers and worsening economic conditions in their home countries. Many Republicans acknowledge these factors as well, but they are more likely to blame rule changes by the Biden administration and not enough security at the border generally, as well as failure to finish the border wall specifically.
Along with concerns about resources, many Americans also express concerns about the long-term effect these current migrants will have on American society. Relatively few think they will make American society better in the long run, while nearly half think they will make it worse. Those who think the migrants will make society worse tend to lean Republican. They overwhelmingly oppose providing housing and services for the migrants in their local areas, and think the U.S. needs to focus more on securing the border than streamlining the application process.
This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,157 U.S. adult residents interviewed between January 3-5, 2024. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as past vote. The margin of error is ±2.8 points.

Data: LendingTree; Map: Alice Feng/Axios
Single women in Utah own more homes than single men — and overall homeownership is now majority female.
Yes, but: Utah's homeownership rate among single women still ranks dead last in the nation.
Why it matters: Roughly 60 years ago, women couldn't even get a credit card or a mortgage without a male cosigner. Now, the share of single women homeowners eclipses that of single men.
Driving the news: Solo women mortgage applicants made up 18% of the market in 2023 — a share that's slowly grown since mortgage platform Maxwell started tracking applicants' gender and marital status in 2021.
1 in 3 women with partners bought alone because they were in a stronger financial position, Maxwell's annual Single Women Home Buyer Report found.
State of play: Census data shows 9% of homes in Utah are owned by single women, compared to 7% by single men.
What they're saying: We're seeing a rise in the number of women homeowners — and a strong shift toward women-led households, Urban Institute researcher Jung Hyun Choi tells Axios.
By the numbers: In 1990, fewer than a third of total households (married and single) were headed by females. In 2021, the majority (51%) of households reported being female-headed.
That increase was mostly driven by married households, Choi says, in which 43% claimed to be female-headed in 2021. That's compared to 8% in 1990.
Of note: In most age groups, women outnumber men. ""This is more a reflection of strength in numbers than economic vitality,"" Pew researcher Richard Fry tells Axios.
The other side: Opportunity isn't equal. Single Latina and Black women have the lowest homeownership rates of any group in the U.S.
""Thirty-nine percent of Latinas who are single and live alone owned a home in 2021, compared to close to 62% of non-Hispanic white women in similar circumstances,"" Axios' Astrid Galván reports. ""The rate for that year was 37% for single, non-Hispanic Black women who live alone.""
Single women with children also face low homeownership rates compared to other groups, including single men with children, Choi's research shows.
The intrigue: Maxwell's report shows Gen Zers and millennials made up the largest share of single women mortgage applicants in 2023."

Activists with the People's Response Network were outside City Hall on Friday, noting Johnson said during his campaign for mayor that he would fire Arwady.
They also said CDPH needs to do more with community-based organizations and focus more funding on Black and Brown neighborhoods.
""Removing Arwady is just one step towards the remedy of racial inequity in funding,"" said Creola Hampton, board chair of Black Leadership Advocacy for Healthcare Equity.
""I support Dr. Arwady, and I hope she does fine in her endeavors that she's going to take, but we're here now to support Mayor Johnson so that he can revitalize rebuild and restrengthen and reorganize the Department of [Public] Health,"" said Dr. Barbara Norman, who served as deputy commissioner at CDPH under former Mayor Harold Washington.

IRVING (CBSNewsTexas.com) — It seems almost too good to be true.
Destiny, luck, or perhaps a touch of divine intervention came together at Woodhaven Presbyterian Church in Irving, where Pastor Shane Webb's desire to become an organ donor was answered in the most remarkable way.
It was six years ago that Pastor Webb was serving at a church in Mount Pleasant, Texas. During that time, an urge stirred within him, one that would eventually lead to a selfless act of kindness.
""I heard a presentation about the need for kidney donation. It set off something in my heart, to provide that gift for someone,"" Webb said.
Even after moving to Irving, the urge persisted, becoming a constant nagging feeling.
""I never thought I could take off that much time, I didn't know anyone I knew who needed one,"" he admitted.
However, fate had its own plans, as a member of his congregation shared a story that would change both their lives forever. And it happened unexpectedly one day at a church event.
""She's a member of my congregation; she told me this story about her granddaughter that really needed this transplant, and I said, 'Well, you can have one of mine,'"" the pastor recalled.
Sounds easy enough, right? But donating is harder than it seems.
According to UC Davis Health, the odds of a total stranger being a perfect match for a specific kidney patient are approximately one in 100,000.
""You are a match with a complete stranger. I mean, what's the likelihood of that?"" Webb said.
Well, for them, it happened.
Claudia Hagman has battled kidney problems for over a decade, and her journey took a critical turn in 2021, when—at just 25 years old—she had to begin dialysis. Not only did the pair have to be a match, but Webb also had to be healthy enough to donate.
And in May of this year, their lives were forever changed as the transplant took place.
""I now get to go see my friends, and in the spur-of-the-moment go on a hike. Just live, and not be afraid of my own body,"" said Hagman.
Though rare, Webb believes their story was destined to unfold precisely as it did.
""For me, it was the answer,"" he said. ""This was the right time and the right place. It confirmed it was right to donate my kidney."""

177c68cd-22e6-47cb-8d60-c8a95a8a8995,Five Tips for Interacting with Recruiters,"After years of candidate-driven markets, the dynamics are shifting in the opposite direction. In recent years, employees started to move around to get a salary increase, but it is coming to an end now. Employers are no longer willing to match salary expectations to fill a position and are less flexible to a remote setup.
As the tables are turning, it is becoming more important for candidates to understand that recruiters are not obligated to work with them. Introducing them to potential hiring managers is a service, and job seekers must do their part to remain on the roster.
As a recruiter, I hear it all the time that candidates get upset when recruiters ghost them, but in reality, most of the time, there is a good reason why they become unresponsive. I am not talking about unfinished processes when candidates don't get feedback about their candidacy. I mean a complete stop of communication. Here are five tips for interacting with recruiters that can help prevent this outcome.
1. Be respectful and treat them as a partner. Even during candidate-driven market years, there is a rule: treat your recruiter the way you want them to treat you. Recruitment is hard work, and consultants are also human beings. Show them some appreciation, and they will happily open doors for you. If they submit your profile to their client and you get an interview opportunity, call them after the interview to debrief so that they can inform the hiring manager of your impressions.
2. Listen. When you interview with a recruiter, they assess your skills and try to match you with open opportunities. It all starts with an interview when they ask many questions and try to create your ideal employer avatar with you. They will also make recommendations so that you can make sure that you have a real shot to get a certain job. It all starts with you, though: you need good self-awareness and an open mind. Good recruiters give feedback about how the interview went and how realistic you were. For example, whether your salary expectation is within the market range and if they believe they can place you with one of their clients.
3. Be open to coaching. Good recruiters take the time to coach their candidates to help them land a job interview with their clients. It's in their best interest to help you shine, so please don't take their advice from ego. If a consultant tells you that next time, please ensure your background is not messy and your microphone is set up on time, it is not the end of the world. It shows that they care about you and want you to present well!
4. Be honest with them. Sometimes, candidates don't feel comfortable sharing if they are already in talks with another firm. Trust me, most of us are not asking this because we want to send in our candidates for the same job. It is OK to keep the company name confidential, but we want to make sure that we have enough time to put you through our clients' process. In other words, please tell us if you are entertaining the idea of getting an offer tomorrow. Feel free to say no if you don't like the job opportunity we presented. If you had a bad experience with an employer and they let you go, that's fine. We can still help you. Please remember that we want to work with candidates who are straight to the point and will do the same in return.
5. Try not to burn bridges. Most agencies work from a database with all the information about your candidacy. If you did something that made a bad impression (didn't show up for an interview without any reasonable explanation or was dishonest about something in your past, for example), chances are that your candidate file will be marked. The information will remain in the system even after the recruiter you originally worked with.
I hope these examples help you develop lasting business relationships with recruiters. As the market conditions change, remember that staying human and playing nice always pays off. Nurturing relationships with others can help us in every walk of life."

Robert Kraft's foundation wants people to ""stand up to hate"" with Super Bowl ad
BOSTON - Robert Kraft's Foundation to Combat Antisemitism (FCAS) has a commercial airing during the Super Bowl and it aims to bring awareness to the silence that is taking place when it comes to hate in America.
The commercial features Civil Rights icon Dr. Clarence Jones, who helped draft Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ""I have a dream"" speech. Jones sat down with the Patriots owner for three hours at his home in Boston before shooting the commercial. The two had deep discussions about the important role Jewish people had in the success of the Civil Rights movement.
""See, what you're saying is so important today,"" said Kraft. ""That people have lost the history of the bond of our people.""
FCAS President Tara Levine said they chose to run their ad in the Super Bowl because of the rise in antisemitism taking place across the country. At the FCAS command center at Gillette Stadium, they track 300 million social media platforms and sites. They said in the past three months, the number of Google searches for the phrase ""kill Jews"" has increased by 1,800%.
""We hope the commercial gets Americans to stand up to hate and to no longer be silent,"" said Levine.
Levine said Jones provides a rich history and authenticity to the ad.
""We were so delighted to be able to feature him in this ad speaking about the importance of standing up to hate but specifically standing up to the silence,"" said Levine.
Kraft's Super Bowl commercial is a 30-second ad that will run during the first half of the game. Once it airs, the team at the command center will then track the impact that it makes.
""First, we'll be watching the command center to understand what are the conversations, what are the posts,"" said Levine. ""We will also be watching our own site. We want to understand increase in traffic and how many people are requesting blue square pins.""
The commercial shot by an ad agency in Los Angeles and cost $7 million.
""They are a Black-owned agency and that was a really important part of us creating this ad in partnership with them and being able to tell this story, this story of Dr. Jones authentically,"" said Levine."

Earlier this month Axios Cleveland presented a list of the 25 biggest Rock & Roll Hall of Fame snubs, and, not surprisingly, the reader responses rolled in via email and on social media.
Driving the news: The nominees for the class of 2024 are expected to be announced in the next few weeks.
Our list was topped by Joy Division/New Order, Chic, Sonic Youth, John Coltrane and MC5.
Meanwhile, readers had strong opinions about who they think does and doesn't deserve to be inducted:
Matt M.: Mary J. Blige is awesome but not rock and roll. It's crazy like last year and Dolly Parton. She's awesome, but absolutely nothing to do with rock and roll.
Chris A.: Kenny Loggins belongs in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.
Yaron Y.: You forgot Foreigner.
Jay P.: Little Feat and Tower of Power too.
Kyle G.: The Monkees are missing among many others.
Andrew L.: I consider Mötley Crüe being left off your snubbed list a snub in of itself.
Keith M.: No. 1 on any list of snubs needs to be Carol Kaye.
Dan D.: Dude, all of your listed inductees didn't do what it takes to be a part of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. I'm a pretty solid fan of a lot of the people you have on the list, but in no way did they do a thing to improve or go above and beyond for the rock 'n' roll scene.
Brian D.: I still do not understand why Phil Collins' solo work does not get any love. If Peter Gabriel gets in for solo work, then Phil Collins is way more popular.
Kenneth W: Boston is one of the biggest snubs of all time. Considering who they're letting in lately, the Rock Hall is a joke!
Scott P.: Sadly, bands like Bad Company, Boston and Foreigner are again overlooked. They ruled the airways in the 70s and 80s.

f49c34f6-3eae-49e8-b0a8-637e26300df8,"Putin is on his way out, but things could go from Vlad to worse","Well the Russian invasion of Russia turned out to be vastly more successful than the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
After 16 months of stalemate, with Russian forces bogged down by incompetence, corruption and infighting, the Ukraine war yesterday boomeranged right back at Vladimir Putin.
The rebellion by his Wagner militia is the most significant challenge to him since he came to power 23 years ago.
And though Putin´s former ally Yevgeny Prigozhin pulled back his advance on Moscow – allegedly to avoid bloodshed – two things now seem clear.
The first is the likelihood that this is the beginning of the end of the war in Ukraine.
Russian forces have been at a stalemate for over a year now, having failed to seize the Ukrainian capital in the opening days of the war, and proving unable to gain any significant new territory since.
By contrast, after accusing the Kremlin of deliberately bombing his own troops, Prigozhin in 24 hours managed to storm into Russia, take over at least one city and get within a few hundred miles of Moscow. Vladimir Putin appears to have fled the capital.
Whatever happens now, it is impossible to see how Russia will be able to regain any momentum in Ukraine.
Prigozhin in 24 hours managed to storm into Russia, take over at least one city and get within a few hundred miles of Moscow. TELEGRAM / @razgruzka_vagnera/AFP via Getty Images
Since the start of the conflict Putin has relied on mercenary groups like Wagner who report to their own commanders.
This has both allowed Putin to circumvent the incompetent Russian military but also set up a problem for himself.
Because when these militias had any success the resulting glory went to the militia heads, not to Putin and his “special operation.”
The Russian position now could hardly be worse. The Ukrainian counter-offensive has already begun, and the Ukrainians are now fighting an opponent bitterly divided within itself.
Prigozhin has accused Putin and his defence minister of pushing young Russian men into a meat-grinder of a war, as well as of deliberately bombing Wagner positions.
He has also said that Russia only went into Ukraine because of lies pushed by the top brass of the Russian military.
In such a situation, and in the midst of an apparent coup attempt, how could Russia possibly win an already unwinnable war in its neighboring country?
Russian President Vladimir Putin appears to have left the country. AP
The second thing that is now obvious is that either Prigozhin or Putin will have to go. But whichever it is, the iron grip Putin has had on his country for almost a quarter of a century is finally loosening.
For now it looks like it is Prigozhin who has stepped back from the brink.
But Russia will remain on the brink for the foreseeable future. Yesterday a visibly furious Vladimir Putin made a video message in which he said that Prigozhin´s actions were a “betrayal” of the Russian people and a “stab in the back” of the country and its people.

Never miss a story. Check out more newsletters
There is now talk of some moving around of personnel at the top of the Russian government.
For months Prigozhin has been blasting Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and the country´s top general, Valery Gerasimov.
Some people think that Prigozhin may be placated if these men were to be fired or replaced.
But it is far too late for that.
Prigozhin´s statements have not simply been a criticism of two people. Anymore than his brief march on Moscow was about a couple of top brass.
His statements and actions have been an attempt to overturn the whole rationale for the war, its operation, and the people who started it. It is a grab not for land but for power.
That is not a fire that Vladimir Putin can put out by a bit of mere cabinet rearranging.
Putin will have to act, fast and ruthlessly.
Already his internal security service, the FSB (formerly the KGB), have said that they have opened a criminal case against Prigozhin for armed mutiny, before claiming also to have dropped it.
Meanwhile it has been reported that over the past 24 hours the homes and former homes of members of the Wagner militia have been raided by the FSB.
All of which suggests that Prigozhin also knows that this is a fight to the death between him and Putin. One of them is going to have to go.
There will be those in the West who will be cheering Prigozhin on.
Not least because the weaker Putin is the more likely it is that his illegal and bloody war in Ukraine might finally come to an end.
But while that would certainly be a desirable end, almost nothing else in this saga should be cheered on.
Prigozhin as just as much of a thug and killer as Putin. Perhaps even more so.
What we are seeing may well be the beginning of the end of the war in Ukraine. But it is almost certainly also the beginning of the end of Vladimir Putin.
Few people will mourn that fact. But anybody with any sense of history will remember that the history of Russia is that everything can always get worse."
760be3bb-8eae-4728-82f9-14e8f6905c5c,College Admission: Shaping Sausage And Slicing Salami,"getty
When I applied to college over thirty years ago, I had no clue how they were making admission decisions, and honestly did not give it much thought. For the general public, college admission remains shrouded in mystery–decisions are made behind a curtain in what often feels like a game of pin the tail on the donkey. Application review elicits images of admission deans blindly assigning acceptances, throwing darts at a board, or rolling dice to determine an applicant’s fate. There is little understanding of how the sausage is made as enrollment leaders build a class. Maybe that lack of full transparency is not all bad, because the truth is that it is not a “fair” process, nor was it designed to be. Knowing all the conversations that happen within an admission committee might be deflating for applicants who ultimately don’t control what goes into the meat of admission decisions.
This week, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to render a decision about race-based admission, and there has been a hyper-focus on how and why decisions are made and who benefits from these systems. They are important conversations that will shape the lived experience of students in college and will have a long-lasting impact on our schools, workforce, and society. What colleges are permitted to consider could come down to subtle nuances, and like Justice Amy Coney Barrett noted during oral arguments last fall, these distinctions about identity and experience could be “slicing the salami pretty finely.”
What does this all mean for the average college applicant? To really “butcher” this metaphor, please focus more on how and where and you choose to buy your meat and less on the ways the sausage is shaped or the salami is sliced. This you do not control, just as you have zero agency over the way the system is designed. Leave that for the policymakers to screw up.
Here is what I hope you will consider:
Slots and spots: The truth is that almost every college (especially the most selective) are limited in how many students they can accept and enroll. I urge you not to approach admission as a zero-sum game wherein if you are not granted an acceptance, it means someone else “took your spot.” It was not yours (or theirs) to begin with and to view these decisions in such a narrow frame is destructive all around.
Just deserts: If you are denied admission, it is not a punishment for something you failed to do. Often when students are not accepted, their response is, “If I had just taken that extra AP course” or “If I had only been elected as president of my club.” These are false narratives and not helpful as you try to make sense of outcomes. The truth is the decision unlikely hinged on one factor.
The blame game: When you get bad news, it is natural to want to find fault. Where did things break down? Who is responsible? Students wonder if their recommender said something damaging in their letter or the high school didn’t send transcripts in time. Resist the compulsion to look for a culprit and if you need to blame something, chalk the decision up to an imperfect system.
Jedi mind tricks: Don’t try to get in the head of an admission reader or predict their decision-making process. You can’t anticipate what the admission committee is looking for or how they are going to react to your application. Honestly, what they had for lunch that day, the weather, or how they slept the night before might have more influence on the decision than anything. Use the space you have on the application to tell them what you want them to know, not what you think they want to hear. Be genuine and trust in who you are. This will lead to the right match and a fuller you.
Ultimately, I was denied admission to the college I wanted to go to most and waitlisted at the runner-up. I still don’t know why, nor is it important. I had other great choices, which I narrowed to two finalists and made a decision based mostly on extraneous factors that I am now embarrassed to reveal. I had a fulfilling college education and learned immeasurably about the subjects I studied and myself. I could have done this at any of these schools. I had friends that went to the schools on my initial list and transferred, and others who thrived. This is all to say that this process is neither linear nor predetermined. Focus more on the meat of the experience and less on how it is shaped or sliced and you will be bound for success."
4e231e60-2e30-453d-ac78-ce5296ea8ecd,Even The Washington Post Exposes Biden's Corruption,"Virtually the entire Democratic Party has harshly condemned House Republicans for their vote to inquire whether there are enough witnesses, reliable documents, and curious and honorable legal scholars who believe that President Joe Biden is guilty of improperly enriching himself and the entire Biden family.
Georgetown University professor Jonathan Turley is one who thinks the Democrats can't honorably dismiss the GOP case against the president as they are clearly doing. The American people also seem to think the Republicans are on the right side here.
With the formal approval of the inquiry into the president's conduct, the Democrats, argues Turley, are in denial of elementary facts that even the public thinks is scandalous.
Here's the way he put it in a recent column: ""Despite overwhelming evidence of a corrupt Biden family influence operation worth millions of dollars, not a single Democratic [House] member voted for an inquiry into the allegations.""
Every Democrat, he lamented, ""voted to stop any further inquiry."" Nor have their stentorian outbursts against the GOP convinced the public. Nearly 70% say they believe Biden has acted unlawfully or unethically.
The Democrats' chief propaganda organ in Washington, however, at least acknowledged in a major editorial that President Biden's actions have been deplorable, at best, which is more than most liberal publications have done.
Hunter Biden's lawyer Abbe Lowell says Hunter would never have been charged if he had a different last name because he had already paid the back taxes that he owed when indicted.
""That's debatable,"" stated the Post. But what's not, said the editors, ""is that Hunter Biden would never have earned most of the money he allegedly dodged paying — $1.4 million in federal taxes over four years — if not for his last name.""
He had no other qualifications to be on the board of directors of the energy firm Burisma in 2014 except for his last name, the Post chided. And it was, indeed, a ""scandal"" for President Biden ""to insist that his son had done nothing wrong.""
Especially when ""he clearly had behaved so grossly — personally and professionally.""
Nor should the president ""have falsely claimed in October 2020 that his son 'has not made money' in China."" Nor should his son have ""coarsely invoked his father in text messages seeking payment from a Chinese business associate.""
The Post editorial was not as powerful as Bill McGurn's Dec. 5 piece in the Wall Street Journal. But it was scathing enough to give absolution to the House GOP's determination to find out what other inappropriate actions the president may have taken on behalf of his son and the entire Biden family.
So far, however, not a single House Democrat has publicly questioned President Biden's conduct. Moreover, most have backed those who damned the Republicans for voting to see if there is more corruption beneath the surface.
The McGurn article reveals in sordid and indisputable detail how corrupt the president has been and that he has been lying to the public about it for years.
During the 2020 debates with Donald Trump, he dismissed Hunter's laptop — much of it implicating his dad's knowledge of his son's and his family's business dealings — as a Russian disinformation operation.
When Trump brought up Hunter's overseas business dealings, Biden vigorously denied the charge.
""My son,"" he said, ""has not made money"" in China. Trump's assertions, he insisted, had been discredited.
Biden continues to claim that neither he nor his son or others in his family took money from China. But in federal court in July, McGurn pointed out, ""Hunter Biden himself refuted his father's claim.""
Hunter Biden admitted to Judge Maryellen Noreika that he received $684,000 from CEFC, a Chinese company with connections to the Communist Party.
Then there is the House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., whose panel is charged with digging into President Biden's financial dealings. Comer found that ""money from China"" ultimately funded the $40,000 check to Joe Biden from his sister-in-law.
Based on his investigative work, which hasn't been refuted, a Comer aide, speaking for the congressman, says there is ""now a pattern of members of the Biden family using their bank accounts that have been funded by Chinese and other foreign entities to send money to Joe Biden.""
The president's defenders, McGurn writes, can't bring themselves to see any wrongdoing. But the evidence is piling up, with even powerful allies like the Post giving the president hell for continuing to engage in corrupt practices and lying about it.
McGurn put it this way: ""The president and his defenders continue to insist there is no evidence of wrongdoing. But while there may not be absolute proof, there is plenty of evidence — and it's growing.""
And, as McGurn suggests, what the Post says is a scandal will not help the Democrats in the next election and may very well bring Biden down.

Security is an important consideration for businesses and organizations in nearly every industry—which means security and surveillance devices are just about everywhere. Retailers want to protect themselves against theft. Hospitals want to keep their patients and staff safe. Critical infrastructure sites want to stop trespassers, schools want to protect students and manufacturers want to keep operations running smoothly.
Whether your business is a local laundromat or an international retail chain, there’s a good chance you’re using surveillance cameras to keep people and property (or properties) secure.
In recent years, those devices have become significantly more advanced. Improvements in image quality and processing power have made it possible for businesses to run advanced analytics on the network edge, improving the accuracy and reliability of security alerts.
But those same improvements have made it possible for businesses to leverage their devices for other purposes as well: Cameras once used exclusively for security are now being used for business intelligence purposes, helping to generate valuable new insights and streamline operations. This has created an important opportunity for businesses to generate significant added value from their existing security devices.
Security isn’t an expense—it’s an investment.
Security devices are typically viewed as an expense, but they can actually provide a net positive for organizations that leverage them properly. True, it isn’t always easy to understand the value of stronger security—after all, how do you quantify a break-in that didn’t happen, or put a dollar value on a general feeling of safety?
But research conducted by IBM found that consumer attitudes toward safety and security have shifted since the Covid-19 pandemic, with many now listing security as a key factor when they consider visiting a physical location. That means security devices become not an expenditure, but an investment, driving additional visitors to the location.
Whether you run a retail shop or manage a stadium, more visitors through the door usually lead to more revenue. But today’s organizations can leverage their devices for purposes that go far beyond safety and security, and, thankfully, the benefits from these new and emerging applications are much easier to quantify.
Leverage video for security and beyond.
It’s hard to overstate how much deep learning has impacted video analytics. It’s analogous to the upgrade from flip phones to smartphones; it has fundamentally changed the way video and audio surveillance devices are used.
Deep learning processing units (DLPUs) are now standard on many devices, meaning that the advanced capabilities that come along with deep learning technology aren’t limited to organizations with expensive and extensive security deployments—they are accessible to just about everyone. That means even a small business with just one or two security cameras has access to advanced capabilities, and they may not even know it.
Modern analytics can be used to track the volume and behavior of visitors within a location at given dates and times, allowing businesses to optimize store layout and allocate staff more effectively. The technology is also being used to streamline inconveniences like parking, with analytics now able to identify how many spaces within a garage are open and help guide vehicles to them.
Cities themselves are using analytics to improve traffic flow and identify problem areas like accident-prone intersections. Public transportation agencies are using them to monitor the cleanliness of subway stations and bus terminals. Today’s video analytics can effectively be used to measure and analyze anything captured on camera.
Of course, it’s important to note that it isn’t just these advanced video capabilities helping today’s businesses generate additional value. Audio solutions can be used to warn visitors away from off-limits areas or warn employees that they are blocking an emergency exit, preventing disruptions—or even costly workplace safety fines.
Access control solutions are also helping organizations streamline their operations. The ability to issue visitor passes via app or QR code doesn’t just improve security—it improves efficiency, as well. Partners, vendors, delivery drivers and other approved visitors can come and go as needed, saving time without sacrificing security.
Ultimately, that is the key: The security technology being used by today’s businesses often has unexplored business applications that can make them not just safer but more efficient as well. And it provides a path forward for organizations looking to get the most out of their existing security tools.
Take steps toward maximizing your device value.
Step 1: Consult with experts. Conduct an inventory of your existing security devices and reach out to both manufacturers and integrators to better understand their capabilities. They may be able to point you toward possibilities you were not previously aware of.
Step 2: Regroup with internal stakeholders. With a better idea of what your devices are capable of, it’s time to connect with internal business leaders to identify which capabilities may be able to address existing problems. It’s important to include stakeholders from across the business who may have unique ideas for leveraging these capabilities.
Step 3: Get to work. Once you have a sense of how your devices can be better utilized, work with an integrator or other expert to put that plan into action. They should be able to advise you not just on how to unlock those capabilities, but how to refine, calibrate and maintain them over time, ensuring that you maximize not just short-term value, but long-term value as well.
Don’t leave money on the table.
Given the capabilities of modern surveillance devices, businesses utilizing those devices for purely security purposes are effectively leaving money on the table. Business and IT leaders should be in regular contact with both manufacturers and integrators to ensure that they fully understand the capabilities of the devices they have in use to confirm that they are getting the most out of them.
While improved security can be a draw for customers on its own, today’s businesses can also leverage their devices to generate the business intelligence and operational insights needed to increase efficiency and generate real, quantifiable ROI.

Rasavong’s body still tenses up when recounting, in particular, a call from an elderly woman.
“She was so disgusted by me and yelling and screaming, and the only thing I can remember hearing her say at the end was ‘Go back to the country you came from you dog-eating mother-effer,’” Rasavong recently told The Associated Press.
Within days, he closed that restaurant because it no longer felt safe between the harassment and people loitering in the parking lot outside of business hours.
The false accusation tapped into a longstanding slur against Asian cuisines and cultures that has persisted in the U.S. for over 150 years, dating back to the xenophobia that grew in the U.S. after Chinese immigrants started arriving in more visible numbers in the 1800s and other Asian communities followed. It’s also one that Asian American communities are fighting against.
It may be astonishing to some that a claim rooted in a racist stereotype took down a family’s restaurant three years after “Stop Asian Hate” became a rallying cry. But for many Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, it’s something they’ve heard before as an insult or under the guise of a “joke,” along with other negative reactions to the actual foods of their cultures. In December, a comedian received some backlash for dressing like a UPS delivery driver and walking into an Asian restaurant with caged puppies for a social media video.

There is hope though that more people will learn to tell truth from trope. Since the pandemic first fueled anti-Asian hostilities, AAPI communities themselves have tried to take control of the narrative that Asian food is “dirty,” “weird” yet “exotic.” Furthermore, the appetite to learn about food from the Asian diaspora has only grown across traditional and new media.
Still, there were moments where Rasavong felt like nobody, even media, was on his side. He said a few reporters approached him assuming the claims were true.
But he soon received tons of community support, and the closure ended up being a new beginning.
A shopping center property manager offered him the chance to take over a suite vacated by another restaurant. Nkundwe P. van Wort-Kasyanju, a graphic designer in the Netherlands, and Los Angeles-based interior designer Danny Gonzales proffered their services for free. Hana Luna Her, a local artist, painted the mural. By the Nov. 3 grand opening of the new space, Love & Thai definitely felt the love. The place was bustling all day, Rasavong said, and the city presented a proclamation.
Rasavong is holding onto the belief that he went through this whole saga for a reason.
“There’s a journey that we’re supposed to go on,” said Rasavong, who declined to say if he’ll pursue legal action. “Don’t get me wrong. People need to realize this business is not easy ... But you know, we believe in what we’re doing and so far so good.”
In actuality, consuming dog meat is something that has happened in various parts of the world for centuries, where they weren’t seen as domesticated family pets, said Robert Ku, author of “Dubious Gastronomy: The Cultural Politics of Eating Asian in the USA.” Greeks and Romans referenced it. The French also ate dog meat during World War II.
But when Chinese immigrants came to the U.S., it was linked to them as part of “the myths that the Chinese were these bizarre people who had bizarre diets,” Ku said. “It was one of the attractions of actually going to Chinese restaurants back in the day because it came with ‘danger.’”
As other Asian immigrant groups came, the stereotype spread to include them.
“This is a real just blurring of the Asian identity where it doesn’t matter if you’re Thai or Korean or Vietnamese or Cambodian. You’re all the same,” Ku said.
Along with the false allegation of eating dog meat, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders over the generations have often faced disgust and worse from others when they’ve brought their cultures’ foods from home to public spaces like school or work.
They’re taking steps to fight back, like in 2021, when San Francisco-Bay Area-based writers Diann Leo-Omineto, Anthony Shu and Shirley Huey self-published “Lunchbox Moments,” a compilation of over two dozen personal essays and illustrations that raised $6,000 for charity.
The project became “a powerful thing for all of us,” Leo-Omineto said.
“We tried to show it’s not always about being in relation to being American or being white or assimilated,” she said. “You can have moments of joy, too...I hope that it opened people’s minds a little bit more — or made them want to try new foods.”
It’s actually been a big year in publishing and food media for Asian cuisine. Publishers Weekly dedicated a feature in August entirely to Chinese and Taiwanese food after observing nine new cookbooks on the subjects were coming out this year. Several of the authors grew up outside of Asia. The titles range from “Vegan Chinese Food,” to “Kung Food” and “A Very Chinese Cookbook” from America’s Test Kitchen. Also, children’s book author Grace Lin released “Chinese Menu,” which relays folklore behind favorite Chinese American dishes. They all share personal anecdotes and readers often seem drawn to “personality-driven” cookbooks, said Carolyn Juris, features editor.
“It’s not just about the recipes. It’s about the stories behind them and I think people respond to that,” Juris said.
Like any other culture, Asian cultures encompass many different regional cuisines and nuances. With the growing Asian diaspora, it’s not strange that so many cookbooks can be mined and “publishers are savvy enough to know that there is a market for these books,” Juris added.

1a7968ef-0826-419c-903b-5f0285e57380,A Klimt painting that was lost for nearly 100 years after being confiscated by Nazis will be auctioned,"A painting by Austrian artist Gustav Klimt that was believed to be lost for about 100 years has been found – having been secretly owned by a private collector for decades. The painting, which was confiscated by the Nazis, is being auctioned as part of an agreement to turn in art once confiscated by the Nazis, according to auction house im Kinsky.
The Austrian auction house says the unfinished painting ""Bildnis Fraeulein Lieser"" (Portrait of Miss Lieser) was one of the artist's last works before his death. It is unclear who ""Fräulein Lieser"" is exactly, but experts believe it could have been one of several women in the Lieser family, a wealthy Jewish family in Vienna who were clients of Klimt.
The woman in the portrait visited Klimt's studio nine times to pose for him, the auction house said. The finished product is a three-quarter portrait of a woman against a red backdrop, adorned with a cape on her shoulders.
Klimt started the portrait in 1917 and died of a stroke in February 1918. He left the painting—with small parts unfinished—in his studio and it was given to the Liesers.
A masterpiece lost for nearly 100 years will be auctioned after being found with a private collector. im Kinsky
After that, the fate of the painting remained a mystery. A photo of the portrait likely taken in 1925 at an exhibit came with a note: ""1925 in possession of Mrs. Lieser, IV, Argentinierstrasse 20."" The black-and-white image was the only evidence of the portrait's existence – until now.
It is unclear what happened to the painting between 1925 and 1960, when the family of the current owner obtained the portrait. The painting was passed down to the current owner through three inheritances.
The auction house called the portrait a ""sensation,"" and said it will be auctioned on April 24. ""A painting of such rarity, artistic significance, and value has not been available on the art market in Central Europe for decades,"" the auction house said.
""Bildnis Fraeulein Lieser"" is being auctioned as part of The Washington Principles, a 1998 international agreement that established the procedure for returning art stolen by the Nazis.
Last year, Klimt's ""Dame mit Faecher"" (Lady with a Fan) was sold at auction in London for over $100 million, setting a new European art auction record.
Before the auction of ""Bildnis Fraeulein Lieser,"" the painting will be on display in Switzerland, Germany, Great Britain, Hong Kong and other locations."

With my clients, I am not just a psychiatrist and executive coach—I’m a healer on my own profound journey of growth, healing and transformation alongside my clients.
Besides the experience of guiding my clients through their transitions and growth processes, my own struggles and revelations have led me to develop an approach that combines my medical training with powerful psychological tools and spiritual principles for transformation.
Science and spirituality have long been studied as separate fields, yet I believe that integrating spirituality with scientific practice has many benefits. Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, considered the belief in God and religion to be delusional, while Carl Jung, founder of Jungian analysis, saw spirituality as a central feature of human experience. Albert Einstein sought to reconcile these opposing viewpoints, stating that “science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.”
Spirituality generally entails an individual’s internal sense of connection to something beyond oneself. This could be perceived as God, a Source, a Higher Power, Mother Nature, the Universe or even a set of transcendent values like hope, trust and love. To be clear, spirituality doesn't necessarily require belief in God. By this definition, even an atheist can be spiritual if they are connected to, and in alignment with, something greater than themselves. Whichever form spirituality takes, one thing is for certain—it has the potential to help people who are suffering from physical and psychological ailments.
The Healing Power Of Spirituality
What is the value of integrating spirituality and science? From a medical standpoint, numerous studies have shown that spirituality enhances physical health, mental health and subjective well-being while reducing addiction, distress and suicidal behaviors. Pehr Granqvist, professor of developmental psychology at Stockholm University, found that belief in God or a Higher Power can serve as a positive and secure relationship in one’s life; it can even compensate for the lack of other positive attachments. Being a member of a supportive religious or spiritual community can provide consistent and positive connection and a sense of a higher purpose for oneself.
One study of cancer patients found that spirituality was associated with less distress and better quality of life, regardless of how threatening cancer was to the participants’ lives. In “Depression: Dispirited or Spiritually Deprived?” mindfulness expert Craig Hassed revealed that people who attended church weekly were less likely to be hospitalized for any reason, and when they were, they spent less time as inpatients than those who went to church less frequently. While the benefits of spirituality for mental health, physical health and well-being are profound, the unfortunate truth is that relatively few doctors actually take the time to inquire about their patients’ spiritual beliefs and practices.
Holistic Coaching: Convergence Of The Spiritual And The Scientific
Just like spirituality and science can complement each other in medicine, they can also do so in the realm of coaching. Spirituality, as a subjective and transcendent experience, plays a crucial role in improving overall well-being and health. Acknowledging and attending to coaching clients’ spiritual needs can enhance healing, foster positive connections and provide a greater sense of purpose and fulfillment.
Sir John Whitmore, the esteemed pioneer in business coaching, once opined: “Coaching is unlocking a person’s potential to maximize their own performance.” To help clients optimize their workplace performance, I utilize a holistic coaching approach that underscores the importance of both spirituality and science.
According to the Center for Creative Leadership, a holistic coaching approach understands that ""people are a combination of mind, body, and spirit and will respond best when all aspects of their being are considered, engaged, and valued."" They share that a holistic coaching approach entails exploring deeply held core beliefs, conducting life-work balance assessment, discussing the ""undiscussables"" (e.g., weight, grief, etc.) and looking at personal drivers (e.g., what are competing commitments?). I believe it also entails giving coaching clients concrete tools, like meditation, mindfulness and yoga, to explore the spiritual dimension of the human experience.
I have found that using a holistic coaching approach can powerfully transform my clients’ personal and professional lives. It enables them to gain greater insight and clarity into their lives and obtain a new sense of purpose as they feel connected to something greater than themselves. I have also seen firsthand the positive influence of spirituality on resilience, hope, optimism, peace and comfort—thereby helping unlock my clients’ potential to become the best versions of themselves.
A holistic coaching approach transcends the traditional boundaries of coaching by providing a comprehensive platform for individuals to explore the interconnected facets of their being: mind, body and spirit. This paradigm shift holds the promise of a more compassionate and integrative approach to coaching—one that resonates with the diverse needs and aspirations of individuals seeking profound transformation.

858594ed-ab98-4e27-9fa7-2064439a6187,Tens of thousands of Las Vegas Strip hotel workers at 18 casinos could on go strike this month,"Tens of thousands of Las Vegas hotel workers set a deadline Thursday for a sweeping strike, threatening major disruptions to the city’s economic backbone that could coincide with the Strip’s inaugural Formula 1 races later this month.
The Culinary Workers Union said about 35,000 members whose contracts expired earlier this year are ready and willing to walk off the job at 18 casinos if deals aren’t reached by Nov. 10 with casino giants MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts.
That’s five days before the Las Vegas Grand Prix weekend, which is expected to bring thousands of people to the Strip, is set to kick off with an opening ceremony.
At a news conference, Ted Pappageorge, the union’s secretary-treasurer and chief contract negotiator, urged tourists and Formula 1 ticket-holders to support the workers if they go on strike by not coming to Las Vegas or crossing the picket lines.
“We will be communicating to ask customers that they should take their business elsewhere,” he said.
Formula 1 did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
Pappageorge said the union and its members hope it doesn’t come to a strike but that “workers are prepared, united and ready to strike if necessary.”
Nevada’s largest labor union, with about 60,000 members statewide, hasn’t gone on strike in decades.
A walkout would be the latest in a series of high-profile labor unrest actions around the country — from walkouts in Hollywood to UPS’ contentious negotiations that threatened to disrupt the nation’s supply chain — and would follow hospitality workers walking off the job last month at Detroit’s three casinos, including MGM Grand Detroit.

In Las Vegas, the 18 properties that could be impacted by a strike are Aria, Bellagio, Excalibur, Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, New York-New York, Park MGM, Caesars Palace, Flamingo, Harrah’s, Horseshoe, Paris Las Vegas, Planet Hollywood, The Cromwell, The Linq, and Wynn and Encore Resorts.
The union’s deadline comes after yet another unsuccessful round of negotiations with the three casino companies. A spokesperson for Wynn Resorts declined to comment. Caesars and MGM Resorts did not respond to emailed requests for comment.
Negotiations have been underway since April over topics such as pay and working conditions.
Members currently receive health insurance and earn about $26 hourly, including benefits, union spokesperson Bethany Khan said. She declined to say how much the union is seeking in pay raises because, she said, “we do not negotiate in public,” but the union has said it is asking for “the largest wage increases ever negotiated” in its history.
Hospitality workers — from bartenders and cocktail servers to kitchen employees and housekeepers — have also said they want better job security amid advancements in technology, as well as stronger security protections, including more safety buttons.
“We don’t feel safe on the casino floor,” veteran Bellagio cocktail waitress Leslie Lilla told The Associated Press. “We need enhanced security. We need emergency buttons in our service bars. We want to be protected, as well as for our guests.”
The union said it had been patient with the casino companies over seven months of negotiations that spurred large-scale rallies on the Strip, including one in October that brought rush-hour traffic to a halt and ended with the arrests of 58 hotel workers who sat in the street in what they described at the time as a show of force ahead of any potential strike.
“This is our time. This is the labor movement’s time,” Lilla said. “We know that we can’t be a society where it’s just upper class and lower class. There’s got to be a middle. Unions create that middle class.”"

NBC News ""Meet the Press"" host Kristen Welker asked Caldwell about Biden's ""low marks"" on the economy. She added that Democrats believe he needs to shift away from the ""Bidenomics"" messaging.
""'Bidenomics'’ has really become a negative word, especially among Democrats because it’s not working,"" she said.
Caldwell said she was texting with some Democratic lawmakers over the weekend and that they said it was ""not looking good"" for Biden.
BIDEN BASHED FOR CLAIMING TO SEE ECONOMY ‘THROUGH THE EYES' OF SCRANTON, NOT WALL STREET: ‘YOUR ECONOMY SUCKS’
""These members said that it is just not looking good for President Biden politically out there, that he would probably lose some swing states if the election were held today. So they have a lot of work to do to once again, like I said, to try to get credit for the successes that he’s had over the past two years, which he keeps on getting blamed for everything bad that’s happened,"" she said.
MSNBC host Symone Sanders said she was confident the Biden campaign understood that the ""Bidenomics"" message was not working.
Several recent polls have pointed to bad news for the president. A Fox News poll released in November found that 78% of voters rate the economy negatively.
The same poll found that 67% of voters don’t see any signs the economy has started to turn the corner. Biden also had a 40% approval rating among voters.
JEAN-PIERRE CONFRONTED WITH POLLS SHOWING ‘BIDENOMICS’ ISN’T POPULAR WITH AMERICANS
A poll from August conducted by The Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, found that just 36% of Americans approve of Biden's handling of the economy.
A Democratic strategist recently told NBC News that whoever came up with the ""Bidenomics"" slogan should be fired.
""Whoever came up with the slogan Bidenomics should be fired,"" one anonymous Democratic strategist told NBC. ""It’s probably the worst messaging you could ever imagine.""

Two people familiar with White House discussions reported that the president was initially reluctant to reclaim it to promote a growing economy, worrying it could backfire.
Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., also admitted, ""I don’t like it either.""
""The people that he [Biden] stands for don’t deal with economics,"" Clyburn told NBC. ""They deal with day-to-day issues. They have to educate their children and feed their families and develop their communities — and that doesn’t sound like ‘Bidenomics.’""

Here’s the calendar:
House Republicans meet tonight at 6 p.m. ET behind closed doors to hash out their differences.
GOPers conduct a candidate forum on Tuesday, hearing the pros and cons of those running for speaker.
USER'S MANUAL TO THE EFFORT BY SOME GOPERS TO RETURN MCCARTHY TO THE SPEAKERSHIP
On Wednesday, the conference takes a secret vote on who it wants to nominate for speaker on the floor. Keep in mind that the nomination only goes to whichever candidate secures a majority of the conference. So that figure could be as low as 113 (if they include the three non-voting GOP delegates to the House).
However, the full House votes for speaker. A successful speaker candidate needs an outright majority of all House members voting for someone by name on the floor. So that figure is 217 if all 433 House members participate.
""This is going to be a grind,"" said one GOP member to Fox.
The absolute earliest the House would take a vote on speaker is likely Thursday. And it could take longer than that, frankly.

""To the president, turn off the barbecue and speak to the American people to be the leader the world is looking for,"" McCarthy said Monday morning.

""Oct. 7 was the largest hijacking of social media platforms by a terrorist organization,"" said Tal-Or Cohen Montemayor, the founder of CyberWell, an Israeli tech nonprofit that catalogs antisemitic online speech.
The ""horrible, vicious antisemitic terror attack … acted as a catalyst for an outpouring of Jew hatred across the world,"" she added.
GROUPS FEAR FACULTY THAT DEFENDED HAMAS COULD SET CALIFORNIA STANDARDS: 'INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF ANTISEMITISM’
CyberWell uses AI to analyze thousands of posts in real time and flag content that is ""highly likely"" to be antisemitic. The nonprofit saw an 86% spike in such content after Oct. 7, according to a recent report. Facebook alone saw a 193% increase, but Montemayor said X had a higher ""baseline"" level of antisemitic content before the terror attacks.
Across the board, the outpouring of anti-Jewish hatred and graphic violence after Hamas' attack caught social media platforms off guard, Montemayor told Fox News. Livestreams showed Hamas kidnapping and executing families, videos circulated of women ""being paraded in the streets in Gaza after being violently raped"" and ""live lynchings of Israeli soldiers"" were posted on TikTok, she said.
""The psychological warfare with social media is still happening today,"" Montemayor added, with Hamas ""releasing footage of hostages making statements under duress and then showing their bodies or even torture videos.""

Online antisemitism is currently the most rampant Montemayor has seen during her career. The nearest precedent was October 2022, she said, after Kanye West made hostile comments about Jewish people.
""Whenever there's been conflict in the Middle East, we've seen an increase in both antisemitic speech and counter speech,"" said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason Foundation, a libertarian think tank.
Companies don’t have a legal or moral obligation to censor speech on their platforms, Moore said, but he pointed out that they are competing for customers, so removing the most offensive content might be in their best interest.
""What these companies do have is an obligation to provide a place where people want to be,"" he said. ""So I think the best defense we have against offensive online speech is a combination of these companies wanting to provide a decent place for people to exchange ideas and information.""
JEWISH-OWNED SHOP VANDALIZED IN ATTACK REOPENS AS POLICE INVESTIGATE POTENTIAL HATE CRIME
Virtual venom ""absolutely"" correlates to a higher risk of real-life crime, Montemayor said, both in America and across the world.
""You're seeing the intersection of antisemitism and radical ideology, radical Islamic ideology and pro-terror content online that absolutely poses a risk to any Western democracy, including the United States of America,"" Montemayor said.
Antisemitic incidents surged more than 300% in the month following Hamas' attack on Israel, a recent Anti-Defamation League survey found. A separate ADL survey found 70% of participants had been exposed to ""misinformation or hate"" related to the conflict.
""We advise that companies should proactively create guidelines for better-resourced and more intensive content moderation during crises, including increasing the number of moderators and experts with cultural and subject matter expertise related to the crisis at hand,"" ADL spokesperson Kevin Altman told Fox News.
CyberWell started monitoring English and Arabic online antisemitic speech in 2022. After Hamas' October attack, Montemayor said the nature of the hate became ""much more violent.""
An analysis of Arabic-language content showed 62% of posts called for the physical ""harming or killing of Jews,"" she said. ""We just saw an inability to effectively deal with this outpouring of hate speech and pro-terror content in Arabic specifically.""
Social media companies have long struggled with a lack of moderators in languages other than English. Facebook engineers revealed in a 2020 memo that 60% of Arabic content went undetected, POLITICO previously reported.
Arabic content on X and other platforms also went unchecked.
CAMPUS ANTISEMITISM HAS PARENTS, STUDENTS RECONSIDERING COLLEGE CHOICES
But past debate has focused more on the harm to Arabic-speakers than antisemitic Arabic content.
A report Meta commissioned concluded that Facebook unintentionally violated Palestinian users' freedom of expression during the 2021 Gaza war, which began after Hamas launched rockets at Israel. Facebook over-enforced rules when it came to Arabic-language posts and under-enforced Hebrew content, the report found.
Meta also apologized after it mistakenly banned the Instagram hashtag #AlAqsa, which referred to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem’s Old City. The company's algorithms had confused the holy Islamic site with the terrorist group Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade.

While Montemayor awarded social media platforms across the world a ""big fat F"" for content moderation in the wake of Oct. 7, she added that her nonprofit has a good working relationship with Facebook, Instagram and TikTok and has seen a more than 90% removal rate for content CyberWell flagged.
X's removal rate is only 10%, but she's hopeful CyberWell will be able to ""work with that platform to get those numbers up.""

CEO Doug McMillon posted on LinkedIn over the weekend that the donation is a response to the ""increase in antisemitic speech and hate crimes"" that have emerged after Hamas attacked Israel, inciting a gruesome war that has already claimed thousands of civilian lives on both sides.
As the death toll climbs, clashes between supporters of Israel and Palestinians expressing their views on the war have broken out around the world. There have also been reports of antisemitic incidents in communities around the world.

According to McMillon, the funding will support outreach programs to educate people about the history and lessons of the Holocaust and ""the dangers of antisemitism in order to inspire people to confront hate and promote human dignity,"" McMillon added.
The CEO of the nation's largest retailer simultaneously pleaded for Walmart associates to ""keep showing customers and members that we have so much more in common than we do differences.""
McMillon's post comes just days after Holocaust survivors gathered at the museum to ""commemorate the largest targeted massacre of Jewish civilians since the Holocaust.""

McMillon is one of several executives who have spoken out about the war, which started when Hamas killed hundreds of civilians attending a music festival Oct. 7. Many others who were in their homes and in the street were murdered, while others were kidnapped.
The Gaza Strip, which is under control by Hamas, has been under siege since then.
At least 4,200 people have been killed in the war, including at least 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers and 30 Americans. Palestinian health authorities say at least 2,808 Palestinians have been killed and more than have been 10,950 wounded. Thirteen American citizens are unaccounted for."

The 64-year-old rapper sang the national anthem Sunday night ahead of the Milwaukee Bucks’ showdown with the Atlanta Hawks, leaving some fans praising the star and some others scratching their heads.
He delivered what the Bucks called a “flavorful” rendition of the anthem wearing his signature clock pendant chain and a No. 59 jersey, referencing the year he was born. The Bucks invited Flav, whose real name is William Jonathan Drayton Jr., to perform.
Naturally, social media users had a lot to say.
Some found the decision to book the rapper funny, with one person writing on X, formerly Twitter, “Milwaukee is out of control for this,” adding a string of laughing emojis. “I love it here.”
Others applauded the performance. “Flavor Flav just performed the National Anthem for Bucks-Hawks. I didn’t know I needed this until it happened,” an X user posted on the platform. Another viewer added, “Flavor Flav gave our anthem all the reverence it deserves and then some, and anyone who says otherwise is a certified hater.”
And there certainly were some haters in the bunch. NFL Hall of Fame tight end Shannon Sharpe shared a post with a series of facepalm emojis, writing, “NO BOY,” a play on Flav’s famous catchphrase “Yeah, Boy!”
As for Flav, he didn’t seem to care much about the mixed reaction. He addressed the response to his performance in a statement on social media.
“The anthem was a long time bucket list item,,, that was fun!” he wrote on X.
“I can’t live my life worried about what people might say about me. I won’t let that stop me from trying new things and doing things I wanna do. Some people might not like that. But a sure failure is if you stop trying.”
After his performance, Flav took photos with fans, including one boy who held a colorful sign that read “FLAVOR FLAV MY MOM SAYS HI.”
The display has prompted some to point out the hype man’s musical history. Along with being a part of historic rap group Public Enemy, Flav is a talented pianist and also plays several instruments, Public Enemy frontman Chuck D once said.
Social media users weighed on the performance through the night and, among the jokes were some more compassionate reactions.
“I know some people may think this is silly but Flavor Flav said this was on his bucket list,” an X user posted. “He’s had a long career and he’s getting old so it’s important to do things you want to do while you can. I’m glad he got to check this off his list, I hope he had fun.”

The proposal essentially calls for the company to sharply diminish its own greenhouse gas emissions as well as set limits on the emissions of its customers. If the proposal were implemented it would ultimately require the firm to drastically reduce its operations and halt growth.
While shareholders usually invest in companies to increase their wealth by benefiting from a company diligently growing its profits, Arjuna Capital and Follow are not normal shareholders. In fact, they are mission-based activist organizations that exploit the shareholder proposal process to pursue a political agenda that would—if successful—harm the other shareholders. For instance, an Arjuna Managing Director made a headline when she proclaimed that “you can’t deny Big Oil needs to shrink.” Meanwhile, Follow This’ business model entails soliciting funds from the public to buy shares of energy companies to try to force them to decrease the production of oil and gas.
While activists have a right to their opinions, they should not be allowed to pursue them at the expense of the vast majority of shareholders who have invested in Exxon to earn a return on their capital. Shareholder proxy votes by themselves are not cheap—the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) estimates that each shareholder proposal directly costs the target company $150,000 to accommodate. That is why the SEC’s rules governing shareholder proposals limit the number of times proposals dealing with the same topic can be submitted if they fail to gain enough support.
In this instance, Exxon’s shareholders have already considered similar proposals from Follow This submitted in 2022 and 2023, and resoundingly rejected them, with last year’s proposal failing to garner even 11 percent of the vote. The SEC currently requires at least 15 percent support for proposals that have already been considered twice to be resubmitted the following year.
Typically, companies could count on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to affirm and uphold their rules, but since Chairman Gary Gensler has taken the helm, he has used and abused his authority at the SEC to systemically tilt the rules in favor of the activists and away from the typical investor. His acquiescence to the climate-change activists ultimately prompted Exxon to ask the court to force it to uphold its own rule.
Shortly after Gensler’s appointment in 2021 the SEC changed its policy on no-action requests (without going through the formal process of proposing a rule and considering public comments) to explicitly allow proposals that “raise issues with a broad social impact” onto corporate proxies and be voted at companies’ annual shareholder meetings. Until that change companies could exclude proposals on issues that were not materially connected to the company.
That policy opened the floodgates to a plethora of environmental and social proposals that previously never would have seen the light of day. The number of proposals submitted to companies in 2023 increased by 18 percent over 2021, with the bulk of that increase coming from proposals for companies to take action on a variety of social and environmental topics. At the same time, the number of social and environmental proposals receiving majority support have dropped from the already meager 23 percent to a mere three percent, which manifests the simple reality that most investors are investing their money not to pursue political causes but to save up for their retirement.
Even Blackrock, which has tried to position itself as an ESG leader, is wary of the increased politicization of the proxy process. In a report summarizing its voting during the 2023 proxy season, the asset manager noted:
“…there was an uptick in the number of such shareholder proposals that were overly prescriptive or unduly constraining on management decision-making. The number of single-issue proposals where the request made did not have the economic merit also increased.”
The SEC also recently proposed changing the language in its rules to make it even easier to submit such frivolous non-economic proposals if finalized. For instance, the SEC’s proposed rule change would go further to limit the instances where companies could exclude proposals that have already been substantially implemented, are duplicates of other proposals that have been submitted, and alter the characterization of a resubmission to mean only proposals that use the exact same language as previous proposals, which would effectively end any ability to exclude unpopular proposals from a proxy ballot.
Fortunately, the SEC’s policy change “has no legal force or effect” and Exxon is calling the SEC’s bluff by asking the court to affirm their position. If Exxon prevails, the sharply liberal commissioners that make up the Commissions’ Democratic majority may find themselves constrained by the law from pursuing their political agenda rather than protecting investors and encouraging capital formation. Which, of course, are the very reasons the Commission was created in the first place."
0c5d5429-3db0-46a7-8d92-7231ac9ced12,"Arapahoe Cafe, ""soul of Dillon,"" closing doors: ""You're losing the sense of community""","We'll tell you this; the Arapahoe Cafe (or ""A Cafe"") in Dillon is not closing because they don't have the business to stay open.
Owner Doug Pierce and daughter/Manager Bonnie Lehman said it was simply a matter outside their control that's leading them to close up shop come mid-October after more than two decades in business.
""We're not comfortable with the uncertainty of the future. Dillion is wanting to redevelop,"" Pierce said. ""We don't think it's fair for our employees and to ourselves to be living and working in this uncertainty.""
What is certain is that the owners of the land under the A Cafe are looking to sell. Who will buy it is still to be determined, but Pierce and Lehman were given the notice that they would no longer be able to rent the land soon.
""It was very hard, has been very hard and is very hard. Every day is hard,"" Pierce said. ""But we figured it was time to move on.""
The owners were not the first owners to have the cafe open to the public. Pierce said he believes the building was built in 1945, when the Arapahoe Cafe was both a cafe and home to the owners.
""They actually split the building, half for the cafe, the other half for their house,"" Lehman explained to your mountain reporter Spencer Wilson. There are still old photos hanging up in the restaurant that show the split.
After that, a renaming, then another renaming, it eventually ended up in the hands of Pierce and his family. He said there was a lot of work to get done.
""We did not know what we were getting into,"" he said, laughing. ""It was a tough few years we had a lot of rebuilding to do, but we did it.""
What they did was accomplish a tough task for any restaurant, let alone one in a resort town. They created a stable staple for tourists and locals alike, with good food, fair prices (in the mountains, can you believe it?) and staff that knew your name and your order.
""We didn't want it to seem like they were coming to work,"" Pierce said. ""This is where they live, this is where they hang out and this is what they do in life, work is secondary to that.""
Local Cory Carswell said that attitude is palpable when you come for a visit.
""It's definitely the last remaining piece of a small community that, you know, can revolve around something so much as like a diner,"" Carswell said. ""You used to have those places where everyone went to that diner and everyone eat their breakfast and broke bread in the same place.""
""Losing this place... you're losing the sense of community,"" Carswell said. ""I feel like this was the soul of Dillon, the last bit of it.""
""It's just where everyone goes,"" Ruthie Kimmons explained. ""I'm heartbroken, if you go bike riding, you stop here afterward, have some lunch. You play pickleball, you come here for a beer with your friends. Afterwards, the locals hang out,"" she said. ""We are so sad to see this place go away.""
Pierce said he's expecting a discussion with the Dillon City Council Tuesday night regarding ideas to either move the building to another location in Dillon or to rebuild a replica of the building, but neither option will save what he's spent so long building with his family. Even if the building were to be placed or rebuilt somewhere else, it wouldn't be the same, as the location is part of what makes the cafe/bar/landmark special.
""It's a bullseye, we call it,"" Pierce said, laughing. ""Yeah, which is a good problem to have. We've enjoyed it most of the time.""
The restaurant plans to close its doors on Oct. 15."

Man exonerated of murder charge after more than a decade in prison
Man exonerated of murder charge after more than a decade in prison
BROOKLYN, N.Y. - A man convicted of murder who served more than a decade in prison was exonerated Thursday.
Prosecutors now believe someone else was responsible. The former NYPD detective at the center of the case, Louis Scarcella, is accused of coercing confessions in dozens of cases.
Steven Ruffin waited almost 30 years for his exoneration. He was just 18 when he was convicted of the 1996 shooting death of a 16-year-old in Crown Heights.
Brooklyn Supreme Court Judge Matthew D'Emic overturned that conviction Thursday.
""I lost 14 years of my life for a crime I didn't commit. And today will help me to move on from that chapter of my life,"" Ruffin said.
The vacated conviction is the culmination of more than 10 years of effort to clear Ruffin's name. He was paroled in 2010, but always maintained his innocence.
""This case is pretty clear cut,"" Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said.
The Brooklyn DA's Conviction Review Unit concluded that Ruffin did not commit the murder.
Defense attorneys believe that detectives botched the initial investigation, and Ruffin never received a fair trial.
""It's a blessing that we're able, although so many years later, to finally give him back his good name,"" Gonzalez said.
""If you know you're innocent, don't give up on your case. Keep on fighting because justice will prevail for you one day,"" Ruffin said.
Ruffin now resides in the Atlanta area, and is closing the chapter on a dark part of his life, while opening a new one.
""I have two job opportunities for promotions at my current job. So my life is just trending upwards right now. This is like the icing on the cake,"" Ruffin said.
Ruffin said his false conviction never defined who he was, or the man he would become."

Michael McCaul, Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is concerned about what appears to be sensitive U.S. government documents ending up in the hands of Iranian regime friendly media.
McCaul expressed alarm Monday after the Tehran Times, an Iranian outlet friendly to its regime, obtained what appeared to be an internal State Department memo showing U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley had his security clearance suspended.(RELATED: Foreign Oligarch Who Allegedly Paid Hunter Biden For ‘Client’ Services Wins Extradition Case In British Court)
“If this memo is authentic, it is extremely concerning especially since this is not the first time the Iranian regime’s mouthpiece has appeared to have sensitive U.S. government information recently while Congress is kept in the dark,” McCaul said in a press release.
“This latest chapter raises serious questions about how the regime obtained this potentially authentic document and what other sensitive or classified information they may have. The State Department needs to do a top to bottom security review, because I am concerned they have a leak,” McCaul added.
The Tehran Times previously published multiple stories with exclusive details on Malley’s downfall and an audio tape of Malley discussing the Biden administration’s Iran policy agenda.
Malley is under investigation from the House Foreign Affairs Committee for allegedly mishandling classified information while he attempted to restart negotiations with Iran as part of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the Iran nuclear deal agreed to by the Obama administration.
His security clearance was reportedly revoked in July and he was placed on leave by the State Department. McCaul requested documents from the State Department in June related to Malley’s suspension, according to a press release. The State Department informed McCaul in July that it will not answer his questions or provide details on the allegations against Malley.
The FBI is also investigating Malley over his handling of classified materials, CBS reported. It is unclear if the FBI investigation is treating Malley’s situation as a criminal matter.
Malley was fired from Barack Obama’s 2008 Democratic presidential campaign for organizing communications with Iran-backed terrorist group Hamas, the Washington Free Beacon reported.
Iran is listed on the State Department’s list of countries of particular concern because of systematic violations of religious freedom. The U.S. government advises Americas not to travel to Iran because of wrongful detention risks and other potential hazards.
A spokesperson for the State Department told the Daily Caller it is aware of the Tehran Times reports and declined to comment on internal matters. The spokesperson also said Malley remains on leave."

Measuring in at over 180,000 square kilometers, North Dakota serves as one of the least-densely populated states in all of North America—and all of that wide open space leaves plenty of room for wildlife to roam. Across the iconic Theodore Roosevelt National Park, massive herds of American bison and pronghorn can be encountered all throughout the year, while fascinating resident and migratory bird species make North Dakota a particularly underrated destination for seasoned birders. As you plan your next road trip across the Great Plains, be sure to save some room on the itinerary for a nature-focused voyage across the dazzling landscapes of the Peace Garden State.
Theodore Roosevelt National Park - North Unit
The Little Missouri River can be found in all three segments of Theodore Roosevelt National Park. getty
One of North Dakota’s twin crown jewels for wildlife lovers, the North Unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park offers 9,740 hectares of pristine wilderness for visitors to explore. Though not as large or frequently-visited as its southern cousin, this vast preserve offers a similar array of attractions to explore along its 22.5-kilometer-long main thoroughfare, with top sites ranging from the Cannonball Concretions Pullout—a site that’s home to fascinating smooth boulders formed by precipitation—to the dazzling River Bend Overlook. And to sweeten the deal, the Little Mo Nature Trail serves as a top destination for birdwatchers, drawing species like the cedar waxwing and dark-eyed junco to the edge of the Little Missouri River.
Audubon National Wildlife Refuge
The western meadowlark is the official state bird of North Dakota. getty
Officially established in the 1950s, the Audubon National Wildlife Refuge serves as one of the foremost birdwatching destinations in all of the Peace Garden State. Upon arrival, visitors can head into the main building for some insight into the inner workings of North Dakota’s Prairie Pothole Region—a vast expanse of wetlands that plays host to all sorts of migratory birds during breeding season—then set off along the refuge’s walking trails in search of wildlife. Given the many ponds scattered across the area, visitors can catch a glimpse of swamp-dwelling birds like the red-winged blackbird, northern shoveler and common goldeneye, while fortunate visitors may be able to spot a prairie falcon or bald eagle soaring overhead.
Fort Stevenson State Park
Walleye are native to southern Canada and the northern reaches of the United States. getty
Named in honor of an 18th-century structure built on the edge of the Missouri River, Fort Stevenson State Park currently offers a glimpse into the many species that thrive both in and along North Dakota’s sprawling Lake Sakakawea. During a visit, guests are welcome to hit the Flicker Loop Trail in search of prairie dogs and native birds ranging from the orange-crowned warbler to the ruby-crowned kinglet, but the park really shines when it comes to aquatic wildlife. The waters of Lake Sakakawea draw fishers in droves to search for freshwater species, with northern pike, sauger and especially walleye all serving as potential catches.
Maah Daah Hey Trail
Maah Daah Hey roughly translates to ""a place that will be here for a long time"" in the local Mandan ... [+] language. getty
The idyllic beauty of North Dakota is on full display all across the Maah Daah Hey Trail, a rugged path that runs 232 kilometers across the western reaches of the state. While the park draws plenty of mountain bikers and horseback riders throughout the year, its high degree of biodiversity also makes it a haven for wildlife aficionados, with no shortage of birds, mammals and reptiles to discover across the badlands. American bison, pronghorn and coyotes are just a few of the larger Peace Garden State residents that can be encountered during a stroll, while birders should keep their eyes peeled for native passerines like the western meadowlark and spotted towhee.
Theodore Roosevelt National Park - South Unit
Theodore Roosevelt served as the 26th President of the United States. getty
Native wildlife, lengthy hiking trails, and spectacular landscapes abound across the South Unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park, an iconic preserve that earned its current designation in 1978. While American bison are a common sight throughout the park, visitors can also discover a wealth of prairie dog towns perched on the edge of the main road, with the added opportunity to spot raptors like the red-tailed hawk or golden eagle soaring above in search of prey. Vista points like the Wind Canyon Trail and Badlands Overlook provide the possibility of further bison sightings amidst staggering Peace Garden State landscapes, while the visitor center-adjacent Painted Canyon Nature Trail is a must-visit thanks to its high concentration of local passerines."
4d4604cb-7ad9-4eb2-a7f1-f61f8ebebdb2,Stockton substitute teacher sent to ER after alleged attack by 13-year-old student,"STOCKTON — A substitute teacher in Stockton was sent to the emergency room after she was allegedly attacked by her student.
Nataley Martinez is a long-term substitute at John Adams Elementary School and was treated for a concussion, sprained wrist and bruising. She said this was not the first time the student threatened her.
""It is making me question if I want to continue and step into a classroom,"" she said.
Martinez is also months away from finishing up her degree at the University of the Pacific, so this job was part of her teaching hours to graduate.
""All I remember is like my glasses fell off and I was just being pulled in a circle, and I just kept feeling the punch on my head,"" she told CBS13.
Martinez spoke out about the attack for the first time with CBS13. She said she had been covering for another teacher at John Adams Elementary School on Tuesday during her prep period.
Since it was not her class, she decided to give the students a free period to relax and socialize with each other but stay off their phones.
Martinez said one student was lying on the ground while on her cell phone.
""She was like 'F you, I don't need to listen to you. You're just a sub. You only get paid $15 a day. I don't need to listen to you,' "" Martinez said.
Martinez said the girl refused to get up and sit at her desk.
""That's when she started with the threats like 'I am going to kill you, Ms. Martinez. I am going to kill you,' "" she said.
Martinez pressed the panic button in her classroom and the vice principal showed up. Martinez said the vice principal asked her to take the kids out of the classroom with her, but her alleged attacker somehow also ended up there.
""Never once did I fight back. Never once did I try and strike her,"" she said. ""I was just trying to cover my face.""
Martinez's mother said her daughter should have been protected.
""When I got to the school, she had already gone on the ambulance,"" Martinez's mom said. ""They didn't even know where she was at. And I was like 'What do you mean?' ""
Martinez claims this was not the first time she was threatened by the 13-year-old.
""Prior to the day, on Monday, she actually made a threat against me and I reported it to the school,"" Martinez said.
The Stockton Unified School District said Martinez never reported a rumor of threats, but the school suspended the student on Monday for knocking on a door and cussing. She was back in Martinez's first and second-period classes on Tuesday. The altercation happened during fifth period.
""I remember one of the students ran in and gave me a hug and said 'You are going to be OK,' "" Martinez said.
Now, Martinez is recovering and rethinking as she questions the safety on campus and her career.
""Did I make the right choice going into education? Did I make the right choice going into that class? And where was the support? And I didn't have it. I never had any support with the admin staff there,"" Martinez said.
Martinez told CBS13 that on Tuesday morning, she had reminded the vice principal of the threat that Stockton Unified claims was never reported, but to her knowledge, nothing was ever done. She was supposed to start a new job at the school directly across the street next week, but now she is rethinking this.
Stockton Unified sent CBS13 this statement regarding the incident:
""SUSD has been informed of a physical altercation at one of our campuses. There was an incident between a long-term substitute teacher and a student. The site contacted SUSD Department of Public Safety to engage in the situation. DPS notified the district. Officers are performing a full investigation and appropriate charges and discipline are being applied. The safety of all our students, teachers and staff is a top priority.""
Martinez said the University of the Pacific has been very supportive in all of this and has been talking with Stockton Unified about the safety for all of its student teachers. UOP provided this statement to CBS13:
""We learned about the attack from our student the day after it happened. We immediately reached out to make sure she was safe and receiving all the mental and physical health and academic support she needs. The health and safety of our students is always our first priority. Within hours, we initiated a top-level dialogue with SUSD leadership to ensure that any of our students assigned to SUSD schools will be working in safe, attentive environments at all times. Those conversations will continue next week.""
Since the student is a minor, Stockton Unified could not give any details on the investigation or what would happen to the student accused of assaulting her teacher."

[+] Swimsuit Issue Launch at Hard Rock Hotel New York on May 18, 2023 in New York City. (Photo by Taylor Hill/WireImage) WireImage
Rob Gronkowski and Camille Kostek have teamed up to launch a new digital sweepstakes platform called Voomerang. The couple’s mission with the site is to revolutionize how the 1.5 million charities across the U.S. reach vital new audiences by pairing participating celebrities and their charities of choice with fun, give-back initiatives.
Voomerang’s first two digital sweepstakes are officially underway and participants can purchase entries to win some monumental prizes. The initial sweepstakes prize packages, benefiting the Gronk Nation Youth Foundation and the Peter Frates Family Foundation, include two all-inclusive luxury vacation packages valued at over $140,000 and two Chevrolet Corvettes, a new 2023 model and a beautifully restored 1975.
The charitable venture marks the first time the four-time Super Bowl champion and in-demand model/actress have officially worked together on a major project.
“We've done things together, charity events, going and representing ourselves, giving back to the community, but we've really never done business together. And this is our first time doing business together. We thought it would just totally make sense with Voomerang because we love to give to charities, we love to give to the community,” Gronkowski said.
“And why not then go in together and start a sweepstakes company that raises a ton of awareness for charities when we're already giving back all the time to these charities? So it just makes sense for us. We're both glad to do it. And it's really our first time going on a press tour together too, and it's been a lot of fun.”
Both sweepstakes close at 11:59 pm ET on New Year’s Eve with the winners being announced within a few days of the campaigns ending.
“They get to pick what one they would like, and they get to give it away to one of their friends or family members just to get that feeling of how giving feels good,” Gronkowski said.
“What makes it so different from other things that you can enter for a giveaway, is that when Rob and I drive this Corvette of your choice, the restored 1975 Chevrolet Corvette or the brand new 2023, we will be delivering it to their home,” Kostek, who appeared in Sports Illustarted’s 2023 Swimsuit Issue, said.
“That's an experience in itself. It's going to be a good time. We're going to make sure that they feel really good about it. And we get to say, ‘Hey, who is it that you have chosen that if you were to win, that you want to pay it forward to?’ Is it your mom who's been working three jobs for that extra vehicle in her home, or your sister who's graduating student and she has a new gift?”
Although Gronkowski is retired from playing in the NFL after leaving an historic mark on the game, he still keeps up to date with what’s transpiring in the league and he’s not just in TV shape (he appreciated that terminology).
“TV shape, I love it,” the future Hall of Famer said with a laugh. “TV shape is actually going around and talking to random people and just striking up a conversation. There's many people out there. Those are the people that are made for TV that can just talk all day.
“For example, Greg Olsen, when I met him like 10 years ago, I'm like, ‘This guy needs to be on TV,’ and let alone he was announcing the Super Bowl last year as a commentator, which is unbelievable. He does such a great job and he's such a great person.

“But no, it's definitely one thing I like to maintain in my life is staying in shape. I mean, I've been doing it since I've been a young kid running around, doing activities, playing sports. And I just have to. It makes me feel right. I was actually just talking about it about an hour ago. ... I was like, ‘I can't wait to go and work out and run today because I haven't done it in like three days.’ It just makes me feel mentally sharp, makes me feel physically sharp, and it feels like it prepares me for the TV stuff.
“It keeps my brain going, keeps my body moving. So got to stay in shape. If it's doing an activity, playing basketball, if it's just going for a run, or if it's doing a lift, I just still have to do it. I've been doing it my whole life, and I just feel complete doing it as well. And I believe that it helps out all my business stuff too because it keeps my mind nice and clear.”
Kostek weighed in on the role fitness plays in their relationship.
“It's funny. I always say that if we were to ever have cameras in our house and have a reality show, it would be exactly what people think,” she said. “In our living room, there's a mini rebounder in the middle of our floor. It doesn't move.
“There's workout bands all over the house. He does push-ups when watching movies. He made me do a plank while watching football last night, together. I mean, there's foam rollers that you trip on in the middle of the night. It's TB12 (Tom Brad’s fitness brand). It's everything, acupressure mats...”
“You're right. I actually did my longest plank of my life last night,” Rob added. “I did a two-and-a-half-minute plank. I've never really done one over 90 seconds. And I was just like, ""I'm going to do a two-and-a-half-minute plank right now. It was like 9:30. And it hurt. It hurt. I couldn't believe I did it. 90 seconds in, I was like, ‘I have another minute.’ It hurt. Everything was feeling it. That's why I was feeling a little shaky this morning. I forgot I did that plank.”

Camille had a role in 2021’s Ryan Reynolds hit movie Free Guy. She looks back fondly at her time working with top Hollywood director Shawn Levy, who directed Netflix’s NFLX The Adam Project and several episodes of Stranger Things, in addition to other projects. After the actors strike is resolved, he’ll continue directing Deadpool 3.
“Actually, that was the first person I noticed (with Taylor Swift at the New York Jets vs. Kansas City Chiefs game on Oct.1). You're seeing everyone talk about Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively and Taylor. And I was like, ‘It's Shawn right there.’ Shawn is, hands down, one of the best directors I've ever worked with.
“My experience on Free Guy was unlike anything I've ever experienced. I will remember shooting that movie in my second home, the city of Boston, for the rest of my life. And I'm crossing my fingers for Free Guy 2 (reportedly in development).
“Free Guy 2. Let's go!” Rob interrupted to campaign for his girlfriend.
“I'd love to have another experience with Shawn Levy because he is one-of-a-kind. He's brilliant.”
Camille also has a non-toxic perfume coming out called Blonde Bark. The scent is manufactured in France will be out in time for the holiday season."
98c5f8d0-8199-4ea3-b511-df3a6757b8f0,Most Say Businesses Should Be 'Neutral' During 'Pride Month',"Most believe businesses should seek to be “neutral” on cultural issues — particularly in the wake of Bud Light’s and Target’s controversies over the past several weeks — during what society has deemed “pride month,” a recent Convention of States Action/Trafalgar Group survey found.
The survey asked respondents, “With the public backlash against companies like Bud Light and Target, do you believe businesses should continue to promote political themes during pride month, or should businesses seek to be neutral on cultural issues?”
Across the board, most, 61.9 percent, agree that businesses should be “neutral on the issue,” compared to 23.9 percent who believe businesses should still “promote political themes.” Another 14.1 percent said “neither.”
Most Republicans, 81.8 percent, and independents, 66.2 percent, believe businesses should remain neutral and not push a political theme. However, a plurality of Democrats, 46.8 percent, believe they should “continue to promote political themes,” compared to 37.1 percent who believe they should remain neutral.
Further, that particular survey found a plurality, 40.8 percent, indicating that they have boycotted a company for taking “progressive or woke public stances,” followed by 34.7 percent who said they do not participate in boycotts and 24.5 percent who said they have boycotted a company for taking “conservative or MAGA public stances.”
Notably, a plurality of independents, 40.7 percent, said they have boycotted a business for taking progressive or woke stances.
The survey was taken June 5-9, 2023, among 1,088 likely general election voters and has a +/- 2.9 percent margin of error. It comes months after the backlash against Bud Light after transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney — a man who believes he is a woman — bragged of the company sending him a can with his face on it to celebrate his 365th day of womanhood.
The backlash was swift and severe, as Bud Light sales crashed, dropping 29.5 percent for the week ending May 20 alone. Modelo Especial also took the crown as the best-selling beer in the United States last month.
Target also came under fire over this year’s pride month collection, which not only featured transgender swimsuits for adults, but children’s apparel advertised as “Thoughtfully Fit on Multiple Body Types and Gender Expressions.”

Despite the general public sentiment, some companies have not learned the lesson. Coors Light, for instance, opted to proceed with its participation in the Denver Pride Parade over the weekend, which stood as part of Denver’s PrideFest. The event had several well-known sponsors including Nissan, Sheraton, Visa, COBank, Safeway, Chevron, Amazon, JP Morgan Chase, Credit Union of Colorado, REI, Verizon, AARP, Colorado Public Radio, United Airlines, and Xfinity.
That event, which was open to children, as it advertised a “Walmart Family Area,” as well as “Rainbow Alley Youth Area,” also advertised drag queens Salina EsTitties and Marcia Marcia Marcia, as well as Big Freedia, born as Freddie Ross, as center stage headliners.

3d0df910-4a0f-47d9-b66a-e3bea098cbf0,"Prince Harry was victim of phone hacking by U.K. tabloids, court rules","London — Britain's High Court ruled that Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, was the victim of phone hacking by Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN), publisher of the Daily Mirror tabloid, on Friday. He has been awarded 140,600 pounds, which is about $180,000 in damages.
The presiding judge in the case at Britain's High Court, Justice Timothy Fancourt, said in a statement that he had awarded Harry the ""modest"" sum, as the case had shown the Mirror Group ""only played a small part in everything that the Duke suffered"" and ""was not responsible for all the unlawful activity that was directed at the Duke, and that a good deal of the oppressive behaviour of the Press towards the Duke over the years was not unlawful at all.""
The judge said he'd found that only 15 out of the 33 articles that were scrutinized in the case were the product of phone hacking or other illegal information gathering.
""I consider that his phone was only hacked to a modest extent, and that this was probably carefully controlled by certain people at each newspaper,"" Fancourt said. ""There was a tendency for the Duke in his evidence to assume that everything published was the product of voicemail interception because phone hacking was rife within Mirror Group at the time. But phone hacking was not the only journalistic tool at the time, and his claims in relation to the other 18 articles did not stand up to careful analysis.""
He said he'd determined the award for the prince ""in respect of each of the articles and invoices where unlawful information gathering was proved"" and ""to compensate the Duke fully for the distress that he suffered as a result of the unlawful activity directed at him and those close to him.""
In a statement read by his lawyer after the judgement, Harry said he was ""happy to have won this case.""
""I respectfully call on the authorities, financial regulator, police to do their duty and investigate bringing charges against Daily Mirror Group,"" Harry said in his statement.
In June, Prince Harry became the most senior royal to ever take the stand in a U.K. court case, testifying over two days in this case.
Harry, along with other U.K. celebrities, brought the suit against MGN over alleged phone hacking.
The Mirror Group has denied any unlawful information gathering in relation to the 207 newspaper stories mentioned in the case, though it previously admitted that the hacking of phones had taken place at its newspapers.
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have filed at least seven lawsuits against U.S. and U.K. media outlets since 2019, and Harry is currently involved in four cases against U.K. tabloid newspapers.
He is also part of a group alleging unlawful information gathering at Associated Newspapers Limited, which publishes The Daily Mail, and against News Group Newspapers, which publishes The Sun tabloid."

One thing that scared writer-director Bryce McGuire more than the supernatural swimming pool at the heart of Night Swim was the prospect of turning his short film into a feature.
""Seeing where other 'short film to features' that failed, were underdeveloped, unrealized, or just didn't have enough of an idea, meant I didn't even try to adapt into a feature for three years after making mine,"" the filmmaker recalled.
""Even though people would keep saying this should be a feature, and this is right in the middle of the trend kicked off by David F. Sandberg's Lights Out, I was like, 'I just don't want to do a movie that's repetitively just 'boo in the pool' again and again. I knew there had to be a bigger mechanism, a bigger mystery. For me, it was finding the characters.""
Night Swim, produced by legendary horror luminaries James Wan and Jason Blum, is about a family, the Wallers, who move into a new house unaware that something haunts the swimming pool in the backyard. McGuire started by asking himself some key questions. It is exclusively in theaters now.
""What is this specific family? What did they want? What did they have to gain by moving to this house with this pool? As soon as you have the positive side of that, it allows you to keep those wheels turning before the other shoe drops and the negative kicks in,"" he explained. ""I knew that had to be like a family with a real problem to solve, which is a father who is a former baseball pro, who develops a degenerative illness and is trying to try to put their life back together. How do you find contentment with a simpler version of their life?""
McGuire found his answer in the quest for the American Dream.
""I think that pool, both on a mythology level and a symbolic level, represented that slice of that; the opportunity to try and accept your circumstances and be happy with that,"" the director mused. ""Where do you find happiness? What are you willing to do to get it and where does that sacrifice occur? I had to have that idea, but it did not come immediately, so I just waited. It was like the movie Searching for Bobby Fischer, where they said, 'Don't move until you see it.'""
While Night Swim's concept is original, it has all the jump scares, narrative beats, and classic tropes that generations of fans have come to expect. What McGuire set out to do was to be as inspired by his heroes as much he was to add his own twist to what they gave him.
""This is going to be no surprise to you but Stephen King was a huge influence on this,"" he laughed. ""I grew up reading his books, and this pool was my Christine; it was my 1958 Plymouth Fury. This pool was about taking this seemingly positive, innocuous, or banal symbol of Americana, inverting it into something nightmarish and weighted with all this Jungian value.""
""In fact, I'm writing a letter to Stephen right now saying I would love for him to see Night Swim and this was my love letter to the types of films and stories that I grew up reading because of him. Growing up, they soaked into my psyche, and this swimming pool felt like such a perfect symbol and location to ruin. The pool comes with so many memories, nostalgia, and familiarity. It's so comforting as an environment that we can feel that warmth cement under our back, the sun prickly in the water droplets off our arms and baking out there. It's the splash in the pool filter in the drain and all the urban legends. It came with so many ‘gets’ embedded in that.""
Director Bryce McGuire on the set of 'Night Swim.' Universal Studios
However, King and his wealth of work wasn't the only well of influence that McGuire dipped into. The filmmaker also leaned into legacy tech to enhance the homages.
""I wanted it to feel nostalgic, so we shot this using Super Baltar lenses, which were common in the 70s and 80s. It's a very old lens that enabled us to reference movies like Poltergeist, The Amityville Horror, and Burnt Offerings in the texture of the visuals,"" he explained. ""With the baseball tropes in the movie, I was looking to Field of Dreams, The Natural, and Angels in the Outfield because this mystical baseball movie overlaps with the Faustian bargain horror movie. They're both about wish fulfillment, and I loved getting to weaponize the nostalgia when Night Swim goes hardcore. I knew the setup was as cliche and classical as you could imagine, but that was a form of misdirection.""
The homages even extended to a nod to Jaws in the sounds accompanying the sporadic pulsing of the pool lights.
""There's a melodic quality that is a two-note, back-and-forth thing that's very subtle,"" he enthused. ""We didn't want it to be distracting, but I was hoping and praying that someone would find and see that, so this makes me very happy. Thank you for saying that. That's so cool.""
Beyond that, Night Swim's soft-edged, wobbly title card was infused with genre heritage, embracing ""a Stephen King softcover book jacket vibe.""
""We shot that; it's not visual effects. We projected that into a pan of water, into a mirror, and then projected onto the ceiling and then filmed that. So it's all real water, real optical aberrations, and all done analog to reference the grittiness and imprecision of that time, so I love that you picked up on that. I appreciate it.""
The final tool in the creative box McGuire wanted to use as much as possible was practical effects because they make the scares hit differently.
""I'm just grateful to have got to make this movie. It's my first one, and I'm so lucky to be here, but whatever money we did had went toward our water work, underwater housing, the safety crews, and shooting in the tank,"" the writer-director said. ""It's so time-consuming and costly that we knew we had to be strategic but what motivated that choice was that I think it looks better.""
""Even if you end up doing some digital like sweetening or enhancements, which we have some of, it's so different than starting from scratch and building a 3D model. It's going to feel so different when there's a person in a prosthetic suit, the water is on their skin, there's light hitting them, and the performer can feel them over the shoulder breathing. There's a tactile physicality to it that is just better. That's the John Carpenter approach, right? It's got to be tactile, it's got to be practical, so we wanted to try and stick to that methodology."""

84b6f0b9-cfa4-47b7-9c37-737fa01d7ebb,What Should You Do with an Oil Fortune?,"Let’s say you were born into a legacy that is, you have come to believe, ruining the world. What can you do? You could be paralyzed with guilt. You could run away from your legacy, turn inward, cultivate your garden. If you have a lot of money, you could give it away a bit at a time—enough to assuage your conscience, and your annual tax burden, but not enough to hamper your life style—and only to causes (libraries, museums, one or both political parties) that would not make anyone close to you too uncomfortable. Or you could just give it all away—to a blind trust, to the first person you pass on the sidewalk—which would be admirable: a grand gesture of renunciation in exchange for moral purity. But, if you believe that the world is being ruined by structural causes, you will have done little to challenge those structures.
When Leah Hunt-Hendrix was an undergraduate at Duke, in the early two-thousands, she wasn’t sure what to do with her privilege. She had grown up in an apartment on Fifth Avenue, and spent most summers in Dallas with her wealthy churchgoing grandmother. One afternoon, she wandered into a lecture by Stanley Hauerwas, a divinity-school professor whom Time had just named America’s “best” theologian. Hauerwas, as it happened, was also from Dallas; the son of a bricklayer, he could speak in the academic argot of a virtue ethicist or the salty style of a fire-and-brimstone preacher. He rejected the “ahistorical approach of liberal theory,” the assumption that each individual is an autonomous economic unit with a view from nowhere. Instead, as Hunt-Hendrix later put it, “we are born into traditions, and it becomes our task to keep making sense of the world through those traditions, improving them as we go.” Inequality was arguably the defining fact of contemporary American life, which struck Hunt-Hendrix as urgently, intolerably wrong. Hauerwas encouraged his students to reckon with the forces that had shaped their lives, even ones that were set in motion long before they were born.
One summer, Hunt-Hendrix studied with Hauerwas one-on-one, reading Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics. The following summer, she went back to Dallas. On campus that fall, Hauerwas saw her sitting on a bench and stopped to ask about her break. “She sort of sheepishly mumbled something about interning at the family business,” he recalled. “At that moment, it hit me, and I blurted it out, ‘Well, shit, you’re a Hunt! ’ ”
At a place like Duke, where about twenty per cent of the students come from the one per cent, it’s not remarkable to encounter a rich kid. Only in extraordinary cases (Rockefeller, Murdoch) is a surname, on its own, an instant giveaway. Hunt is a common name, but to a Dallasite of Hauerwas’s generation it was unmistakable. “I can’t believe it took me this long to put it together,” he told her that day on campus. “My daddy must have laid bricks for your granddaddy.”
H. L. Hunt, Leah’s maternal grandfather, was a Dallas oilman. In the nineteen-thirties, he built wells all over the East Texas oil field, which turned out to be one of the most prodigious reservoirs of oil in the United States. In 1948, Fortune estimated that he was the wealthiest person in America; in 1967, Esquire quoted a source saying, “There’s absolutely no question about the Hunts being the richest family in the country.” Hunt backed Barry Goldwater, the archconservative senator from Arizona, and George Wallace, the segregationist governor of Alabama. (When term limits prohibited Wallace from seeking reëlection, Hunt encouraged him to run his wife, Lurleen, in his place.) He supported the power-mad senator Joseph McCarthy, the rabidly anti-Communist John Birch Society, and reportedly even the Nation of Islam, which promoted racial separatism. William F. Buckley, Jr., once wrote that Hunt’s “yahoo bigotry” had almost managed to “give capitalism a bad name.”
If Leah Hunt-Hendrix had accepted the notion that she was merely an atomized individual, unencumbered by history, then all of this might have seemed like little more than a coincidence. Her grandfather had died before she was born. Why should she do penance for his sins? And yet, no matter how many times she repeated this argument to herself, she remained unconvinced. She even looked a bit like her grandfather: fair skin, apple cheeks, round face. When Hunt began amassing his fortune, it was not widely understood that the overuse of fossil fuels could ruin the planet. But this was known by 1987, when Hunt Oil finished building a pipeline through the desert of North Yemen; and in 2007, when Hunt Oil signed a prospecting deal with the regional government of Kurdistan (a deal that the Bush Administration disavowed in public but blessed in private); and in 2017, when Rex Tillerson, who had worked closely with Hunt Oil in the Middle East, became Donald Trump’s Secretary of State. Hunt Oil is still family-owned, and still among the largest private oil-and-gas companies in the U.S. It’s now one of several family companies that are part of Hunt Consolidated, including Hunt Energy, Hunt Refining, Hunt Realty, and Hunt Power. The Hunt Consolidated headquarters, in downtown Dallas, is a fourteen-story tower made of steel and glass; the air-conditioning bills must be enormous, yet, somehow, the building is LEED-certified.
Behind every great fortune is a great crime, according to an adage attributed to Balzac—but, unlike the money, the crimes are not fungible. Some took place many generations ago, whereas others are ongoing; some afflict a marginal few, others the whole world. Hunt-Hendrix joined a Christian-fellowship group on campus and volunteered as a community organizer in downtown Durham. She wanted to devote her life to rectifying society’s imbalance of wealth and power, but none of the familiar options—endow a professorship? work at a soup kitchen?—seemed to get to the root of the problem. “Most of us spend our lives only embracing or only renouncing where we come from,” Hauerwas told me. “Leah wanted to do the grownup thing, the exceedingly difficult thing—to look all of it square in the face, and then to find a way to make herself actually useful.”
After graduating, Hunt-Hendrix entered an interdisciplinary doctorate program at Princeton called Religion, Ethics, and Politics. (“In my mind, those are three ways of saying the same thing,” she said.) Two of her main advisers were Cornel West—one of the best-known public intellectuals in the country, always ready to support a labor strike or a socialist candidate—and Jeffrey Stout, who was about to publish “Blessed Are the Organized: Grassroots Democracy in America.” (The book posited that the U.S. seemed to function “as a plutocracy,” and that the way out was to help organizers build power “from the bottom up.”) She took a leave from grad school in 2009 and spent a year teaching English in a small Egyptian city, then another year studying Arabic in Damascus. In Tunisia, she later wrote, she met organizers who “talked about the role of oil companies”—the major public ones, in this case—executing land grabs and “violence against activists who were part of the resistance to fossil fuel extraction.” On a trip to the West Bank, she heard residents’ stories of abject suffering and, moved by compassion and guilt, asked what she could do to help. But many people told her: We don’t want your help, we want your solidarity.
When she came back to Princeton, she proposed a dissertation on the intellectual history of solidarity. (“Vast, interdisciplinary topic,” West told me. “We knew she’d pull it off, but she exceeded our expectations.”) She could spend her life giving money to those in need, she concluded, but charity would only change things at the margins; to help uproot structural inequality, she would have to invest in social movements.
Hunt-Hendrix is now forty and splits her time between New York and Washington, D.C., where she has become a nexus of the New New Left, in frequent contact with street organizers and also several members of Congress. A few times, I saw someone recognize Hunt-Hendrix in passing—Representative Ro Khanna, leaving a progressive centimillionaire’s holiday party in Greenwich Village; a Teamsters organizer at a rally of UPS workers in Canarsie—and ask her, “What is it you do again?” Each time, she struggled to give a concise answer. Basically, she is a philanthropist, though she is reluctant to use the word, given her skepticism toward much of what passes for philanthropy. She donates money to leftist social movements, and she leverages her connections to persuade other rich people to do the same. She gave early funding to Black Lives Matter activists, and to the long-shot primary campaigns of members of the Squad. Since 2017, through her organization Way to Win, she has helped raise hundreds of millions of dollars for left-populist politicians—not quite Bloomberg or Koch money, but significantly more than is usually associated with the far left.

“She has better politics than anyone else who’s that rich, and she’s better at fund-raising than anyone else with her politics,” Max Berger, who worked on Elizabeth Warren’s Presidential campaign in 2020, told me. “Whatever you want to call my faction—the Bernie wing, the Warren wing, democratic-socialist, social democrat—we would have way less power if Leah didn’t exist.” If the faction had enough power to enact its full agenda, many of the richest people in the country would likely lose money and influence; a centerpiece of the agenda is the Green New Deal, which, if implemented in maximalist form, could help put fossil-fuel companies, including Hunt Oil, out of business. “Leah was clearly preoccupied with how a person of extreme privilege can live responsibly in the world,” Stout told me. “That seemed to be, for her, an existential question.”
Legend has it that H. L. Hunt won the lease to his first oil field in a poker game. According to the book “Texas Rich,” the legend is just that: Hunt actually got some of his most prized properties by keeping the wildcatter Dad Joiner in a hotel room for days and wearing him down until he signed away the land, a deal that Joiner apparently regretted for the rest of his life. “In terms of extraordinary, independent wealth,” J. Paul Getty said in 1957, “there is only one man—H. L. Hunt.”
In the press, Hunt cultivated a reputation as a respectable conservative who wore rumpled gabardine suits and carried a sack lunch to work. With the benefit of a fuller historical record, it’s clear that, even by the standards of his time, Hunt was unusually racist and reactionary. He sometimes implied that to give up a significant portion of one’s income, through taxation or philanthropy, was to let the Communists win. He funded a nationally syndicated conservative radio show, “Life Line,” and an endless series of far-right-propaganda pamphlets and books, many of which he wrote himself. “Alpaca,” a self-published novel in the vein of Ayn Rand, sketched his vision of a political utopia; it included a system called “graduated suffrage,” in which rich people would get more votes. Once, after a “Life Line” anchor spoke out against “hate groups” on the air, Hunt privately admonished him never to espouse “opposition to a white-supremacy group.”"

Speaking at the Summit, hosted by the Centennial Institute at Colorado Christian University, Hawley said:
Have we ever in the history of this country had an adminsitration that would use the FBI on parents and treat parents as terrorists because they wanted to have a say in their kids’ education? That is wrong, that is unprecedented, and that has to stop. And we have to take a stand to make sure it stops. This is the left’s war on the family. And then, we come to the heart of it. They’re assaulting the nation. They’re assaulting the family. They’re also going after God. Here is the real truth: the left wants to replace God with idols of their own making. They want to take God out of our history. They want to take the Bible out of traditions. They want to tell us that anything that has to do with faith has to be erased from the public square, and it has to be replaced with their new state of religion of “wokeism.” That’s what they want. That is the struggle that we are facing.
The senator called for a “powerful, strong conservative” movement that will stand against “cultural Marxism” and will stand up for “God, for nation, and will not be apologetic about it.”

They came from all across the city to the Lincoln Park Presbeyterian Church for their 8th Annual Vigil Against Violence. They converged there to pay tribute to those young people who lost their lives to gun violence in the past 12 months. The faces of the victims were posted outside the church.
Organizers say the purpose of the vigil is to unite people from across Chicago to honor and remember the young b n4e victims and to engage in meaningful discussions and actions addressing the systemic injustices that contribute to gun violence.
This year organizers put an emphasis on how the lack of police accountability in Chicago over the decades has led to an increase in violence.
The Civilian Office of Police Accountability was also on hand to speak to those in attendence and was pushing a message of change.
The current situation in the Middle East was also on the minds of many in attendance and was among the many topics the group tackled Sunday."

It ended just before midnight on Sunday in Getafe with a penalty not eventually given to Barcelona, the champions held to a 0-0 draw while Xavi Hernández, sent off and steaming, watched from his glass prison, supporters with outstretched arms positioned the other side of the press box he had been forced to occupy, trying to squeeze him into their selfies. Between those two moments, a lot had happened. A lot more was about to, the fallout fierce.

For the first time a goal from Take Kubo – “great player, lovely lad, terrible hair cut,” according to Javier Aguirre – wasn’t accompanied by a Real Sociedad victory, after Artem Duvbyk scored Girona’s equaliser eight minutes into his debut. Javi Guerra, the kid who rescued Valencia last season, went and did it again with a last-minute winner at Sevilla. And Rafa Benítez’s return ended in Celta’s defeat to Osasuna. There was Sergi Darder, coming on to change the game for Mallorca, Isco playing his first match in 10 months and looking a little like magic again, and above all there was Bellingham. “The Boss,” AS called him after his hugely impressive debut at Athletic.

By the end, though, everyone was talking about what they had just seen and couldn’t unsee at the Coliseum, where Barcelona had suffered but not scored over two and a quarter hours.

El Pais declared there “no more disagreeable place than Getafe”, while in AS, Santi Giménez compared playing them to eating a “nail sandwich,” watching their games being like a Jason Statham film: “Whether he’s facing an eastern mafioso, a Russian mercenary or a 25-metre Megalodon with teeth the size of a Range Rover, you know there’s going to be damage done.” This was the fourth time in a row Barcelona have failed to score there, a third 0-0 to go with a 1-0 defeat. And the day before the game Getafe coach José Bordalás had announced: “Tiki-taka is history; some keep talking about it but it’s gone.” Immediately after it, the Barça midfielder Oriol Romeu even admitted: “We knew what was coming.” But, he added: “This exceeded expectations.”
Xavi called it a “disgrace.”
What was coming was a night so long that the editor of one newspaper said he couldn’t even see it out. “An insufferable disgrace,” Alfredo Relaño called it, saying he “turned off the telly horrified, feeling like ever more sinister spirits are destroying football. An affront to all of us who like football, this doesn’t work.” It was also one that opens debates, about styles and time-keeping and entertainment and whose responsibility it is, about where the line is drawn and by whom. Even Xavi didn’t so much blame Getafe as what you could call their enablers, addressing the way referees officiate and calling for a stopping clock, insisting: “Do that and you end the problems; I’ve said that a thousand times.” It had certainly shown that simply adding time doesn’t really fix anything.
At one point during the game, Ronald Araujo literally jumped up and caught the ball, which might even have been the standout moment. He later explained that he thought the ball was already out of play, which kind of made sense: it often was. There were 10 minutes added at the end of the first half, 16 at the end of the second. A game that started at 9.30pm finished at 11.43pm. Some 116 minutes were used up, never to be given back, and in almost half of them the ball was not in play. There were 20 fouls from Getafe – which, actually, seems quite low – and just over 20% of the ball, red cards for Raphinha first and Jaime Mata later, another for Xavi for complaining that referee César Soto Grado was turning a blind eye, allowing Getafe to get away with it, and no goals.
In short, it wasn’t great. And yet it kind of was. Sport said Barcelona had been stopped “with a beating,” although their failure to truly generate football didn’t help. “Those of us who like good football and entertainment feel sadness and anger today,” complained Enric Masip, advisor to Barcelona’s president Joan Laporta, which he would. “The real time [played] is lamentable. The absurd and provocative fouls are constant. The good player has it tough, the hacker triumphs.”
When Barcelona finally thought they might get the win, a late, late lifeline handed to them when Araujo went down on 99min 59sec, the referee waved it away. Sent to the VAR for a second look, a penalty seeming probable, he instead saw a handball from Gavi – or, to use Xavi’s words, “invented” it. And so Barcelona had been held; in fact, they had almost been beaten, Gastón Álvarez heading just past the post on 105min 19sec. Either way, they had been Bordalásed. Post-game there was even a hint of a smile, a laugh as Romeu discussed what had happened. There is something almost comic about it, after all. Alongside him, Frenkie de Jong claimed “at least 25 or 30 minutes had been wasted.” You could imagine the pair getting back to the dressing room and finding a calling card: congratulations, you’ve met the Getafe crew.

Yet that’s a joke too and an easy one: the way Getafe are often portrayed, these kind of dark, cartoonish figures – and none so bad as Damián Suárez – often becomes a caricature. That is something that their coach is acutely aware of, seeing himself as a victim, a narrative in which he is everyone’s go-to bad guy, a public enemy, an affront to decency and football. It is often exaggerated, but that does not mean it is entirely invented. This is what his teams do: pack a defence, break up the game, get in your face and under your skin. Chip away at the flow, the time, and the opponents. Raphinha was rightly sent off for landing an elbow on Álvarez – “the only violent moment was theirs,” Bordalás said – but that had been part of the plan, a trap laid. Similar moments went unseen, executed under cover of darkness. Getafe completed 167 passes – Barcelona had 659 – but they didn’t want more. When they survived on the final day of last season against Valladolid, they did so with just 64 of them. “At 0-0 they’re comfortable; they waste time, they interrupt the game. That’s their way of competing,” Xavi said.

And in the end, that’s the thing: it works. For Getafe fans, there’s a kind of fun in being the baddies, a rebellion, sticking it to the man, all those fancy dans. No one likes us, we don’t care. So much the better, in fact. The first time the Coliseum – even the name fits – started singing “Bordalás, I love you!” last night was immediately after Raphinha had been sent off. It wouldn’t be the last, and they couldn’t mean it any more. When he joined Getafe in 2016, Bordalás took over a side near the bottom of the second division and changed everything, taking them back to Primera and all the way into Europe. Last season he returned with just seven games to go and rescued them again, those 64 passes all all-time low and yet high enough to complete an impossible misison. Then he had agreed to stay another season. Now he had opened it by doing what he does, and to the champions.
“If we sell the league as a product and this is the result, it’s not good,” Xavi said.

“He’s not doing the league a favour at all. We want to be proud of having one of the best in the world, we can’t criticise it, we have to defend it. I don’t share that view: it’s a way of justifying that they didn’t get three points with an incredible squad, incredible players,” Bordalás replied. “That’s what makes football great: when a small team can face up to a big one, compete with them, get a point and even have the chance to beat them.”"

The speech, uploaded to the South African Parliament’s Youtube channel, was reported by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), and has since gone viral internationally.
South African MP Ahmed Munzoor Shaik Emam: If the City of Cape Town Is Handed Over to the Zionists, There Will Be a Bloodbath; We Will Not Allow You to Make It a Jewish State! #SouthAfrica #antisemitism pic.twitter.com/WWzJ5rgU8v — MEMRI (@MEMRIReports) February 20, 2024
The speech was part of the annual debate on the president’s “State of the Nation” address. Many members of Parliament wore kaffiyehs in solidarity with the Palestinians.
MEMRI noted: “South African MP Ahmed Munzoor Shaik Emam of the National Freedom Party said in a February 14, 2024 parliamentary debate, which was uploaded to the parliament’s official YouTube channel, that if the [opposition] Democratic Alliance hands over the city of Cape Town ‘to the Zionists, the city of Cape Town will be a bloodbath.’ He added: ‘We will not allow you to make this a Jewish state!'”
Cape Town is already governed by the Democratic Alliance.
The city has a large Muslim minority, which is generally peaceful, though it also includes extremist groups.
South Africa has experienced a surge in antisemitism since the Hamas terror attack on October 7 in Israel. Moreover, South Africa has led the charge against Israel on the international stage, accusing Israel of “genocide” at the International Court of Justice.
Emam’s speech has gone viral partly for that reason: while South Africa accuses Israel of “genocide,” a member of Parliament is threatening genocide against Jews.
Critics also noted that the speech was not merely anti-Israel or anti-Zionist, but also antisemitic.

An analysis conducted by the University of Toronto found foot traffic in New York City's Midtown and Lower Manhattan districts is only 66% of what it was in 2019, placing the city's recovery rate near the bottom of the rankings and in line with other cities that have struggled to bring back workers to their downtown areas.
New York City's 33% drop in foot traffic landed the city's recovery rate at 54th out of the 66 cities studied. For comparison, San Francisco, California – with a downtown area that has had a notoriously difficult time recovering post-COVID – ranked higher, with a 67% recovery of foot traffic.

In HBO’s hit TV series The Last of Us, mind-altering fungi turn most of humanity into shambling zombies. Well, I’ve got good news and bad news. Most scientists say there’s no chance of a zombie apocalypse. But the world is in the grips of a fungal pandemic—one that’s wreaking havoc on the crops that feed the world’s growing population.
Today, fungal diseases wipe out almost a quarter of the world’s crops before they’re harvested, and another 10-20% post-harvest, decimating staples including rice, wheat, corn and soy. And things are getting worse. Monoculture farming and globalized supply chains help fungi spread, while climate change leaves plants vulnerable to infection. In 1994, just one in 250 alerts from the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases concerned fungal plant pathogens; by 2010, they accounted for one in 20 emerging diseases.
If these diseases infected people, I believe they’d be headline news. But fungal crop pathogens are difficult to spot in the field and easily spread via unseen spores in our air and soil. That’s a problem because these difficult-to-see diseases do untold damage, destabilizing the global food supply chain and threatening to cause famine on an epic scale. It’s time for us to focus on new ways of spotting fungal infections earlier and treating them before they spread so we can avert a real fungal apocalypse.
An Invisible Crisis
To see why this matters, consider this: Today, we’re all eating less tasty bananas because of fungal disease. If you walked into a grocer in the 1900s and bought a banana, you’d get a Gros Michel—a creamy, candy-flavored cultivar that makes modern bananas seem starchy and bland. In the early 20th century, however, a Fusarium wilt strain called Tropical Race 1 laid waste to Gros Michel crops, triggering shortages immortalized in the 1923 song “Yes! We Have No Bananas.”
In response, food scientists developed the Cavendish banana—a less delicious but fungi-resistant fruit that now accounts for most commercial banana production. There's only one problem: A new fungal strain—Tropical Race 4 (TR4)—is devastating Cavendish plantations across Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Facing 100% yield loss, farmers are abandoning thousands of hectares of land, leaving 400 million people at risk of losing a vital source of food and income.
TR4 is just one of over 19,000 fungal diseases now affecting our crops. The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that plant diseases cost the world’s economy $220 billion a year, and the amount of food lost to fungal outbreaks is staggering. Mitigating fungal diseases in just five staples—rice, corn, potatoes, wheat and soy—would yield enough extra calories to feed 8.5% of the world’s people. On the other hand, major fungal outbreaks affecting those five crops simultaneously would push 60% of the global population into starvation.
The Worsening Impact
We’re still a long way from that worst-case scenario, but climate change is heightening the impact of fungal diseases. In Kenya, fungal toxins capable of stunting children’s growth or causing cancer and death are now found in 15% of harvested corn.
Pests of all kinds are sweeping poleward from the equator as the planet warms, bringing new fungal infections into areas where crops have little resistance.
Already, American farmers lose an average of $3.2 billion a year to fungal pathogens. In soy fields, fungicide treatments cost up to $25 per acre, but fungal losses in unsprayed fields average about $36 per acre. That leaves farmers with little choice but to keep pouring more chemicals onto their crops, harming the environment, speeding the development of resistant fungal strains and driving up food prices.
Treating The Unseen
There’s no simple solution to the fungal pandemic. Spotting infections in the vast fields of today’s modern agricultural system is difficult and by the time an infestation is visible to the farmer the fungus is well established and the damage to yields is done.
Farmers work to head off the risk of infection by spraying entire fields at predetermined times when agronomists estimate that fungi are the most vulnerable. It’s an inefficient and expensive solution that still sees huge losses to yields even with the massive release of chemicals into the environment.
Most in the industry agree that we need ways to detect fungus earlier and treat affected crops more precisely. Companies like Syngenta are investing in new ways to tackle fungi, including an innovation center to engage farmers and new tools to detect threats to crops using satellite imagery.
They’re also working with my company, InnerPlant, and John Deere on a system using satellites to detect signals directly linked to the physiology of plants that warn of fungal infection in individual plants weeks before symptoms are visible in the field. Such data gives farmers an early warning to act before infestations spread while applying chemicals only to affected plants rather than entire fields.
The chemicals used to fight fungi today are also seeing innovation thanks to cutting-edge, high-throughput technologies that are helping develop new compounds that target fungi based on their specific DNA. Just as promising, research is exploring the potential of microbial fungicides to provide more environmentally-friendly treatments.
Such innovations are urgently needed. There’s no risk of waking up tomorrow to find people wandering around with Cordyceps fungi sprouting out of their heads. But the world is in the grips of a fungal pandemic. With 854 million people short of food and high prices—caused, in significant part, by fungal pathogens—likely to drive 100 million more into hunger in coming years, the time for action is now.
It's time for the industry to expand its innovation pipelines to include systematic approaches that intertwine advances in early detection and discoveries of novel anti-fungal formulations. Likewise, the government must work to speed up the review of new formulations and technologies to get them into the hands of farmers. We can’t afford to keep ignoring fungal diseases.

My college years were in large part a waste. I was an indifferent student and spent most of my unassigned time working on the newspaper instead of converting middling grades to good grades. A sort of academic malaise and a few catastrophic misadventures, some of which I have written about elsewhere, persuaded me that the scholarly life was not for me; a taste for the picaresque (but nothing too strenuous) led me to my current line of work.

Others in similar casts of mind do other things. Alexander Chula, following his graduation from Oxford, found himself teaching Latin and Greek at the crumbling Eton of Africa, Kumuzu Academy, in the hills of one of Africa’s poorest countries, the Land of Fire, Malawi. His account of the nation, Goodbye, Dr Banda: Lessons for the West From a Small African Country, is a curious work, part memoir, part history, part anthropological monograph; nothing else like it was published this year. It has much to recommend it.
Kumuzu was established by Hastings Banda, Malawi’s erstwhile founding father and dictator. Banda was born in a Malawian village in 1906, while the territory was under British rule; by dint of hard work and understated daring, he made his way from his birthplace to Great Britain, where he trained as a medical doctor and was impressed by the importance of the Western classics. The winds of change blew him back to Malawi, where he became the first president (and then president for life) of the new republic.
African dictators of the first generation after the empires left were an evil lot. Jean-Bedel Bokassa, president of the Central African Republic and then “emperor” of the short-lived Central African Empire, spent his country’s entire aid budget and then some on a lavish coronation service. Amid his brutal campaigns of domestic oppression, Uganda’s Idi Amin styled himself King of Scotland and Conqueror of the British Empire. Both had a penchant for human flesh (although at his trial Bokassa denied knowingly engaging in cannibalism, which was anyway only a misdemeanor offense in CAR at the time). Among these fellows, Banda’s gentle despotism is conspicuous.
His ambition to raise up a culture and a tradition from the soil of his nation puts him more in line with Peachy Carnehan and David Dravot than Mobutu Sese and Charles Taylor; although his own Latinity was tenuous (and his Hellenism apparently nonexistent), he wished the Western classics to serve as a model for Malawi the way they had for the great European vernacular cultures of the modern era. One pet project was Kumuzu Academy; another was codifying Malawian grammar. Sure, he banned hippies from Malawi (who wouldn’t, given the chance?), and his later rule was characterized by the ineffectual repression of political enemies, but he wasn’t eating anybody. He just wanted Malawi to stand as an equal in the congress of nations; part of this was teaching Malawians to remember, to build their own traditions, and to relate to the great common patrimony of the past. (They were called the humanities for a reason.)
Banda’s efforts, as presented by Chula, were in large part an effort to regain lost roots. He had been gone from Malawi for decades when he returned; in a pre-literate society of largely temporary infrastructure, it was difficult for him to find people or even places familiar from his youth. Chula argues that something similar is happening at vast scale in the West: Classics are little studied, and those who do study them have a fraction of the facility common even just a hundred years ago. Sincere Christian belief and affiliation is on the decline. Few people relate their daily work back to a context or a tradition much longer than the weekly news cycle. We are in the midst of a great forgetting.
Aid workers still come and go from Africa, but, unlike the almost monomaniacal Christian missionaries of the imperial era—whose brief biographies littering Chula’s narrative provide some of the most haunting passages of the work—they have little purpose in their activities. It’s just feel-good passing through. (A major difference that Chula underlines between the modern aid worker and the missionaries is that the latter would spend their lives in Malawi, while the former spend a year or two in many different places, collecting experiences like bottle caps.) Malawi is perhaps now best known as Madonna’s particular object of charity, and her hunting ground for adoption. Chula shows the disruption that she and her fellow-travelers bring to Malawi. There are types of poverty worse than hunger.
Goodbye, Dr Banda is a strange book, but not one that the reader will soon forget, with its mask-dances and witches and lurid sunrises. It is perhaps the builders of churches and fishers of men, the missionaries—sick, hungry, blind, poor, martyred—who stick in the mind most. They were a sort of solution, those people."

534912b0-1627-42b2-9120-2e6e86442ef2,Giants thrive as underdogs after surprising 2022 season,"The Good Ship Daboll sailed straight and true all summer, with nary a ripple in the calm seas, and no unexpected choppiness to knock anything or anyone off course.
No hard knocks and no “Hard Knocks’’ for the Giants.
Not a decibel of Super Bowl chatter and no comparisons to the 1985 Bears on defense.
Daniel Jones got up on stage and sang at a Zach Bryan concert in Queens, but the Giants’ quarterback is strictly second-fiddle in a metropolis that now has Aaron Rodgers stomping around, with Godzilla-like impact, for the Jets, and by extension causing reverberations throughout the entire NFL.
The Giants will open their season Sunday night against the Cowboys at MetLife Stadium, a national showcase for two longtime NFC East rivals.
The next night, though, the Jets will get the solo exposure of “Monday Night Football’’ against the Bills in the building they share with their older and historically more successful stadium business partner.
If Under the Radar were a condition, the Giants would be diagnosed with having a strong dose of it.
“Honestly, I think that’s the way we like it over here,’’ veteran defensive lineman Leonard Williams told The Post. “I don’t think people on this team are expecting us to be in the spotlight all the time. We like to be considered underdogs and prove people wrong. I think that makes all the guys and the team play with a chip on their shoulder. I think that’s the way we like it.’’

Now hold on there. Did everyone forget the Giants, in Brian Daboll’s first season as head coach, defied all expectations to finish 9-7-1 and win a playoff game for the first time since the 2011 season?
Based on a player-by-player roster rundown, there is evidence aplenty that the 2023 Giants are more talented, certainly faster and more sound than the 2022 edition.
Why such second-class status in their own environs?
“If you’re comparing it to the Jets, they just got Aaron Rodgers, who has been one of the best quarterbacks in this league for a long time,’’ Williams said. “Then they also have ‘Hard Knocks’ going on over there, so they’re on TV and in the spotlight. I feel it’s easy for them to be talked about vs. us.
“I don’t think anyone here cares about that type of stuff or talks about it, really. We’re just focused on winning, and I think that’s going to take care of itself.’’
Winning takes care of everything.
The Giants and Jets get to duke it out during Week 8 in late October, and by then we all should have a strong handle on what each team is about.
Of far more immediate concern is righting what has been wrong for so long.
This will be the 12th time the Giants and Cowboys will open a season squaring off, and it has been a brutal opening-day assignment for the Giants.
They are 1-10 all-time in season openers against the Cowboys and 1-11 in their past 12 games in this ridiculously one-sided series.
“I understand that we weren’t able to beat Dallas and Philly last year, but that was last year,’’ Saquon Barkley said. “It’s a whole new year. We’ve got a great opportunity in front of us, and we’ve got to take advantage of it.’’
The Giants, despite their surprising run last year, are second-class compared to the Jets and have taken on an under-the-radar vibe. Corey Sipkin for the NY POST
If the Giants snap this nasty trend, they will be on the receiving end of more attention than they need or want.
“I think we’re in a good spot. I think we improved a lot throughout camp and made a lot of progress to get to this point and I think we’re ready to go,’’ Jones said.
“I mean, I’m 0-2 [against the Cowboys],’’ second-year outside linebacker Kayvon Thibodeaux said. “I’m definitely 0-2, and I definitely don’t like losing, so this is gonna be a time to wipe that slate clean.’’
MARQUEE MATCHUP
Cowboys DE DeMarcus Lawrence vs. Giants RT Evan Neal
We all know what happened the first time these players went at each other. It was Lawrence in a knockout, punishing the rookie Neal during Week 3 last year for three sacks — half of Lawence’s total for the entire season.
Neal said it was the worst game he has ever played.

Neal worked diligently this offseason, changing up his pass protection set to more quickly engage with onrushing defenders.
Lawrence, 31, knows all the tricks and the Giants cannot afford to swing much help Neal’s way, with sack-happy Micah Parsons going at left tackle Andrew Thomas on the other side of the line.
PAUL’S PICK
Go with the Giants in this matchup at your own peril — especially if Darren Waller is unable to play or limited by a tight hamstring. Brian Daboll succeeded on so many levels in his head-coaching debut season, but finding a way to beat the Cowboys and the Eagles was not among the achievements. Have to figure the Giants are better equipped to deal with the Dallas ground game and more capable of putting heat on Dak Prescott. Now, can the offensive line keep Daniel Jones on his feet long enough to find all those upgraded weapons?
GIANTS 27, COWBOYS 23
4 DOWNS
CALLING THE SHOTS: Mike McCarthy made his name in the NFL calling plays on offense as the Packers’ head coach, and it was a surprise when he ceded play-calling responsibility to Kellen Moore three years ago when he took over in Dallas.
Now, however, Moore is the offensive coordinator for the Chargers, and McCarthy is the Cowboys’ play-caller.
“I feel like I’m back in my element and doing what I feel like I do best,” he said. Expect McCarthy to incorporate some of his West Coast offense philosophies.

“It’s the first game and even the first part of the season, there are a lot of unknowns,’’ Brian Daboll said. “Got a lot of respect for coach McCarthy, I mean he was a coordinator back in 2000 [with the Saints]. So, he’s been doing this a long time. Has a good track record, been very successful. What he is choosing to call or how he’s calling it, we won’t know that until Sunday.’’
TALE OF THE TAPE: Dak Prescott is 10-2 starting against the Giants and 10-0 in his past 10 starts. The Giants are 1-7 when facing the Cowboys since Daniel Jones arrived in 2019, and Jones is 1-5 in his six starts against the Cowboys.
Prescott was intercepted a career-high 15 times in 2022, raising questions as to his status as a franchise quarterback after he signed a four-year, $160 million contract prior to the 2021 season.
Jones last season had the lowest interception rate (1.1 percent) of any quarterback in the league.
The Giants this offseason secured Jones with essentially the same deal — four years, $160 million — as Prescott received, and this is the first game for Jones since he got paid.
With tight end Darren Waller (dealing with a hamstring issue), classy receiver Parris Campbell and rookie speedster Jalin Hyatt, Jones has more firepower than any time in his career.
NEW ROLE: Adoree’ Jackson does not get his hands on the ball often enough — just three interceptions in 69 career games — to rank among the NFL’s top cornerbacks.
He is, however, the best the Giants put out on the field, and his speed and savvy as a perimeter corner make him a challenge for opposing wide receivers.
He selflessly and enthusiastically agreed to move inside to fill the slot corner role after rookie sixth-round pick Tre Hawkins stunned the coaching staff and won a starting job.

“I was ecstatic and excited about the opportunity that I was going to be able to have in that position and at the end of the day it’s all about ‘we over me,’ that we talked about,’’ Jackson said.
In the slot, Jackson will see plenty of CeeDee Lamb, the Cowboys’ best receiver.
HIT THE SACK: Tucked into the Cowboys’ 2-0 series sweep of the Giants in 2022 was this tidbit: Dallas sacked Jones eight times in the two games.
The Giants did not get a single sack against the Dallas quarterbacks.
That is … unacceptable. “I think that we played well, just couldn’t finish them, and this is a new year,’’ defensive coordinator Wink Martindale said.
Edge rushers Kayvon Thibodeaux and Azeez Ojulari were on the field together for just seven games last season.
“It was rare,’’ Thibodeaux said. “I told him, ‘Listen, somebody asked me, are we gonna have a meeting at the quarterback?’ And I told him I’ll carpool if I have to.’’"
914a0210-01a9-4220-8923-e9dbb611f138,San Antonio schools close due to heating failures,"San Antonio Independent School District will close its more than 90 campuses Thursday and Friday to diagnose and address heating issues that kept the majority of its schools cold amid this week's freezing weather.
Why it matters: The district's infrastructure failure leaves students with multiple lost days of learning and parents scrambling for child care.
Repairs could end in a large bill for a district that has aging buildings and has already deferred maintenance due to lack of funding.
What they're saying: ""We're not going to open a single school until it is warm, safe and a good place for learning,"" superintendent Jaime Aquino said at a press conference Wednesday.
Aquino called the issues a ""significant systemwide failure"" and said he takes full responsibility.
Catch up fast: SAISD initially closed 20 schools Wednesday amid the heating issues, a list that eventually grew to 31 schools before the end of the school day.
Details: District officials checked campus heating systems on Monday, when students were off for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and found them working. But officials made ""a human error"" in not choosing to override the typical schedule and run the boilers 24/7 during the arctic weather, Aquino said.
That led to broken and frozen pipes that caused ""major issues"" in the infrastructure, Aquino said.
The broken pipes led officials to supply some schools with bottled water this week.
Zoom in: The district will work with the teacher and employee union to decide if and when students will make up lost learning hours, Aquino said.
Officials considered remote instruction but decided against it for this closure period.
Curbside lunches will be available at all campuses between noon and 1pm Thursday and Friday for families to pick up.
By the numbers: About 70% of SAISD's schools experienced some kind of heating issue as of Wednesday, Aquino said.
Districtwide attendance was just 54% on Tuesday and 70% on Wednesday.
Of note: Aquino did not answer questions about how much the repair work will cost or where the money will come from.
Flashback: The district recently repaired the heating and cooling systems in some schools through its 2020 bond. But this week's freezing weather was the first test of new HVAC systems, Aquino said.
That's because the district closed in prior cold snaps due to precipitation and ice. Officials had decided to keep schools open this week because of the lack of precipitation.
The big picture: ""We are the oldest district in the city with an aging infrastructure, and we've had to defer maintenance because of our financial situation,"" Aquino said.
""The difficulties our schools face in ensuring appropriate temperatures for learning…are a direct result of the long-term, systemic and chronic underfunding of public education in our state,"" Alejandra Lopez, president of the union San Antonio Alliance, said.
What's next: Repair work over the coming days will also include checks for issues with gas pressure or other problems that could have led to the failures."

“They want Donald Trump to go away,” former Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Penn.) told MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle on Monday when asked what his former colleagues are telling him when the cameras are off.

“They know these indictments are going to be devastating for the Republican Party in a general election should Donald Trump become the nominee,” he said, “This is all bad news.”
He said there’s an exception: the “really hardcore MAGA wing folks” who “believe their own BS.”
“But they’re not really dealing with reality,” he said, adding that everyone else knows the indictments “are just devastating politically.”
Later in the segment, he urged Republicans running for the presidential nomination to attack Trump more directly.
“When your opponent in an election is indicted for mishandling classified materials you can smash him from the right that he’s a threat to national defense,” he advised.

58c19e3b-02fc-4c9b-9f8f-2af26951b7b8,United Methodists Open First Top-level Conference since Breakup over LGBTQ Inclusion,"Thousands of United Methodists are gathering in Charlotte, North Carolina, for their big denominational meeting, known as General Conference.
It’s a much-anticipated gathering. Typically it is held every four years, but church leaders delayed the 2020 gathering until now due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
This year, the 11-day gathering runs from April 23 to May 3. Among those assembling are hundreds of voting delegates — the United Methodists from across the globe who were elected to represent their regional church body — though as many as one-quarter of international delegates are not confirmed as able to attend. The delegates, half clergy and half lay Methodists, are the decision makers at General Conference.
General Conference — the only entity that can speak for the entire denomination — is a business meeting where delegates set policy, pass budgets and address other church-wide matters. It’s the only body that can amend the United Methodist Book of Discipline, which includes church law. It also includes Social Principles, which are non-binding declarations on social and ethical issues. There’s worship and fellowship, too.
Yes. This will be the first General Conference since more than 7,600 mostly conservative congregations left the United Methodist Church between 2019 and 2023 because the denomination essentially stopped enforcing its bans on same-sex marriage and having “self-avowed practicing homosexuals” serving as clergy and bishops.
It’s possible. The delegates in Charlotte are expected to vote on whether to eliminate them. Similar efforts have failed in years past, but with the election of more progressive delegates and the departure of many conservatives, supporters of removing the bans are optimistic.
— Disaffiliations: The rules that allowed U.S. congregations to leave between 2019 and 2023. It allowed them to leave with their properties, held in trust for the denomination, under friendlier-than-normal legal terms. Some want similar conditions for international churches and for U.S. churches that missed the 2023 deadline.
—Regionalization: A proposal to restructure the denomination into regional conferences around the world, rather than having distinct names for U.S. and other jurisdictions. It would define the role of regions more precisely and put American congregations into their own regional body. Under this proposal, all regions would be able to adapt church policies to their local contexts, including those on marriage and ordination.
—Budgets: Because of all the disaffiliations, the conference will vote on a much-reduced budget proposal for the coming years.
Though thousands of Methodists with be attending the conference, there are only 862 official voting delegates, from the following regions of the church:
• 55.9% from the U.S.
• 32% from Africa
• 6% from the Philippines
• 4.6% from Europe
• 1.5% from concordant (affiliated) churches
No. As of last week, only about three-quarters of international delegates were confirmed as able to attend, the Commission on the General Conference reported Thursday. The other quarter includes 27 delegates unable to get visas or passports, others who couldn’t attend for various reasons, and 62 delegates still unconfirmed. African groups have strongly criticized denominational officials, faulting them for delays in providing necessary paperwork and information and raising questions about whether African conferences will accept voting results from the conference.
That varies widely, but those long active in the movement to repeal LGBTQ bans are focused strongly on the conference. First United Methodist Church in Pittsburgh, for example, held a commissioning service on April 14 for three members attending the conference in varying capacities. “It will be deeply meaningful for me personally to vote for those changes,” said member Tracy Merrick, who will be a delegate.
They’re part of a larger worldwide family of Methodists and other groups in the tradition of 18th century British Protestant revivalist John Wesley, who emphasized evangelism, holy living and social service. They hold many beliefs in common with other Christians, with some distinct doctrines. United Methodists traditionally ranged from liberal to conservative. They were until recently the third largest and most widespread U.S. denomination. Methodist missionaries planted churches worldwide, which grew dramatically, especially in Africa. Some became independent, but churches on four continents remain part of the United Methodist Church.
5.4 million in the United States as of 2022, but that will decline significantly due to 2023 disaffiliations.
4.6 million in Africa, Asia and Europe. That’s lower than earlier estimates but reflects more recent denominational reports.

Xbox chief Phil Spencer confirmed on a podcast Tuesday that the Xbox Game Pass will not feature any games from Activision Blizzard until next year, noting the regulatory hurdles behind Microsoft acquiring the gaming company hindered progress on bringing games from franchises like Call of Duty and Warcraft to the pass immediately.
Activision Blizzard reported $2.2 billion in revenue in its latest earnings report. Getty Images
Key Facts
“I know there will be some disappointment about that,” Spencer said on the podcast, calling the acquisition a long-term move that has Xbox “excited about the future.” Games from highly popular franchises such as Call of Duty, Warcraft, Diablo and Overwatch ​​will make their way to the pass “sometime in the course of next year,” according to a post from Activision Blizzard on X, formerly known as Twitter. The pass, a subscription-based service that allows players to download a roster of select video games without having to purchase them, starts at $10 a month and goes up to $17 a month for its premium version.
Surprising Fact
The news likely breaks PC and Xbox users’ expectations of new games coming to the service, as Xbox added 20 games to the pass just a few days after Microsoft acquired Bethesda, the creators of the Elder Scrolls and Fallout franchises, in 2021 for $7.5 billion.
Tangent
Call of Duty will remain on both Xbox and Sony’s PlayStation for at least the next 10 years thanks to a deal agreed upon by both companies in July.
Key Background
The regulatory process Spencer noted was a lengthy one endured by Microsoft as it attempted to acquire Activision Blizzard over the course of more than a year. The Federal Trade Commission hindered the $69 billion acquisition for most of that time span, arguing such a deal would be anti-competitive. The FTC expressed concern that Microsoft would make some of the Activision Blizzard games exclusive to Xbox, removing games with millions of players from PlayStation. Microsoft finally secured the acquisition last week days after it was approved by the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority, the final regulatory holdout it had to clear. Microsoft is now the third-largest gaming company in the world by revenue after the acquisition, trailing Tencent and Sony.

Nichushkin knocked in the winner shortly after Kirill Kaprizov drew a penalty for hooking.
Nathan MacKinnon extended his home point streak to 32 games with two assists. He's tied with Guy Lafleur (1978-79) for the third-longest home point run in NHL history.
Nichushkin returned after receiving care through the player assistance program. It was his first game since Jan. 10.
Artturi Lehkonen had a goal 42 seconds into the game for the Avalanche, who made a flurry of deals at the trade deadline. New additions Casey Mittelstadt, Brandon Duhaime, Yakov Trenin and Sean Walker were scattered throughout the lineup.
Devon Toews scored with around 2:30 remaining, but the Wild challenged for offside. After a review, the goal was taken off the board.
Georgiev made 29 saves. He also thwarted Mats Zuccarello's penalty shot with 5:55 remaining. Georgiev was sprawled out when Zuccarello sent his shot wide. Zuccarello was awarded a penalty shot after Andrew Cogliano sent a stick laying on the ice into the Wild forward.
Both teams struggled on the power play, going a combined 1 for 8.
Brock Faber had a goal for a Minnesota team that showed few signs of fatigue after a 5-2 win the night before in Arizona. The Wild remain on the fringe of the playoff picture.
Colorado entered the game as the highest-scoring team in the league, averaging 3.70 goals-per-game. But Filip Gustavsson turned in big save after big save, with an assist to a friendly post as the Avalanche clanged a few shots off the iron.
Lehkonen scored early on a no-look pass from MacKinnon. It was MacKinnon's 70th assist of the season. The last Colorado player to have 70 or more assists in a season was Peter Forsberg (77 in 2002-03).
Faber tied it in the second on a wide-open wrist shot. He now has 37 points this season, the third-highest mark for a rookie in Wild history. He trails only Kaprizov (51 in 2020-21) and Matt Boldy (39 in 2021-22).
For Duhaime, his first game in an Avalanche sweater happened to be against his former Wild teammates. He was a fourth-round pick by Minnesota in 2016 and spent his career with the team.
""Definitely a weird experience for sure,"" Duhaime said.

A deep-diving five-person submarine operated by OceanGate Inc is missing off the coast of Newfoundland Canada, near the wreck of the Titanic. The race is on to locate the 21-foot submarine and rescue the up to five occupants before an estimated 96-hour “life support” window starts to close.
While details are still being released, the U.S. Coast Guard says the submarine launched on Sunday morning, during a tourist-like expedition to view the wreckage of the Titanic, some 12,500 feet below sea level. Operators lost contact approximately an hour and forty-five minutes into the dive.
As of this time, it is unknown if the submarine is lost on the surface of the water, bobbing the waves or sitting on the seafloor.
Rescuers are accounting for either option. A U.S. Coast Guard C-130 long-range patrol aircraft is currently searching for the overdue “research submarine”, and the Rescue Coordination Center Halifax is “assisting with a P-8 Poseidon” that has underwater detection capabilities.
This scenario is a long-feared nightmare for Coast Guards everywhere.
As the global market for extreme tourist adventures has emerged in the maritime, aiming at taking tourists the polar icecaps, the deep seafloor, or to other unique and isolated places, Coast Guards have actively worried that adventure tourism has raced ahead of government regulation, and has put little thought into addressing catastrophic accidents in areas where government support is unlikely.
While Coast Guards can support surface searches, most governments have little to offer the missing mariners if they are trapped underwater.
On the part of the U.S., the decline in America’s submarine rescue capabilities has been dramatic. In 1960, the U.S. Navy boasted nine dedicated submarine rescue ships and two fleet tugs fitted out for undersea rescue work. Today, the service lacks a single dedicated undersea rescue vessel.
The U.S. Coast Guard, the lead agency for America’s at-sea lifesaving missions, has no undersea rescue capabilities whatsoever. Submarine rescue is now a largely privatized endeavor that should, as a matter of routine, work hand-in-hand with the growing and under-regulated fleet of civilian submersible operators.

Undersea Rescues Are Complex, Lengthy Endeavors:
If the missing submarine is stuck on the sea floor, the outlook is grim. Undersea rescues are complex, dangerous things, and, with the demise of America’s dedicated submarine rescue ship fleet, the first task of just getting to the search area is often the hardest.
It takes time to summon what little aid is available. In 2017, to help Argentina locate the missing—and subsequently lost—ARA San Juan (S-42) submarine, America’s elite Submarine Escape and Rescue team was slow to deploy.
The U.S. rescue team first struggled to arrange the eight flights needed to transfer some 365 tons of gear to Argentina. The first airlifter landed 43 hours after activation, and the last landed 77 hours later. Then, lacking a dedicated ship, the team chartered a “vessel of opportunity,” but then needed four days to tear the stern bulkhead off the ship and then needed twelve more hours to load gear aboard.
Only then could the team head to the search area. In the current situation, help would have not even left the pier before the submarine’s life support ran critically low.
Even if rescuers did arrive, few platforms can operate at the depths of the Titanic.
Private-sector assets might be the last resort. The U.S. Navy has largely privatized their salvage and rescue support teams and has little in the way of life-saving support to offer. The last dedicated U.S. submarine search and rescue craft, the fleet’s two unique Pigeon Class (ASR 21) vessels, were cut from the fleet in the mid-nineties and scrapped in 2009 and 2012 respectively.
Only two general salvage ships remain in the U.S. inventory, and they lack the specialized capabilities required to carry out a rescue at the ultra-deep depths of the Titanic.
Private sector specialists like James Fisher and Sons plc can do better under certain circumstances. They are able to move quickly. In 2022, the company demonstrated it could load the NATO Submarine Rescue System (NSRS) onto a vessel and embark in 18 hours. With the war in Ukraine sidelining many large Antonov AN-124 airlifters, the company recently demonstrated the NSRS could be put aboard a U.S. C-5 Super Galaxy. But, again, even if they can get to the site, they may have little to offer at such depths.
Regardless of outcome, the incident is a grim sign of things to come. As civilian undersea activities increase, governments should begin a discussion into how these private sector specialists can backfill missing governmental capabilities—or if governments should reconstitute long-disestablished undersea rescue capabilities so they can better monitor civilian undersea activities and help out when things go wrong.

High-Risk Maritime Tourist Organizations May Need To Stop and De-Risk:
If Russia, the U.S., NATO and others can work together to standardize rescue fittings and, on occasion, coordinate submarine rescue activities, then civilian authorities should be forced to work together to better regulate the growing fleet of private civilian and adventure-tourism-oriented submarines.
Maritime regulators would be well within their remit to demand tourism-oriented “expeditionary” or “research” submarine operators employ standard rescue features—akin to those already adopted aboard military submarines—and order operators to have government-approved rescue plans in place, with assets ready to arrive on site well before life support systems would be at risk of collapse.
Put bluntly, the undersea is no place for amateurs. It is a harsh and unforgiving environment, with little margin for error. Tourists chasing an emotional charge or some burst of adrenaline are certainly entitled to risk their lives, but, as those customers may be poorly equipped to evaluate risk, the government—if they are going to be asked to backstop search and rescue when things go wrong—can step in to give these “seekers” a good chance of survival.
Regulation of the world’s growing civilian submarine fleet can help ensure private and commercial sub operators do what they need to do to minimize risk, adding safety features and maintaining contingency plans that do a bit more than simply turning the catastrophe over to the nearest or most capable Coast Guard, and, in effect, walking away, protected by a legion of lawyers and some iron-clad liability releases."

031178ac-3b7a-49b3-9279-45ece395bc72,"Transcript: United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain on ""Face the Nation,"" Sept. 17, 2023","The following is a transcript of an interview with United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain that aired on ""Face the Nation"" on Sept. 17, 2023.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain. Good morning to you, sir. You have said that you had ""reasonably productive"" conversations with Ford yesterday. Does that mean they're going to put a more generous offer on the table?
UAW PRESIDENT SHAWN FAIN: Good morning, thanks for having us, and, you know, that's up to them. That's- you know, the reason we're in this situation right now is because all three of the Big Three companies chose to wait. They chose not to negotiate for the eight weeks we had. We started this back in July and we told them then, don't wait until the last minute, or you're going to find yourself in a bad position. And unfortunately, they chose to wait to the last week to get down and start talking to get serious about this and that's where we are now. And if we don't get better offers, and we don't get down to taking care of the members' needs then we're going to amp this thing up even more.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But you said progress is slow. Will you order strikes at additional plants this week? Are you preparing for that?
SHAWN FAIN: We're prepared to do whatever we have to do, so the membership is ready, the membership is fed up, we're fed up with falling behind. It's been decades of falling behind. In- in- in especially this past decade, in the- the most wealthiest times in the history of these companies, there is no excuse. These companies have made a quarter of a trillion dollars in the last 10 years, $21 billion in the last six months alone, and our workers wages and conditions have went backwards.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You're asking for 36% pay raises our reporter just laid out there. Stellantis said they've offered 21%. What are you expecting out of tomorrow's negotiation with them? That seems forward movement.
SHAWN FAIN: We've- we've asked for 40% pay increases and the reason we asked for 40% pay increases is because in the last four years alone, the CEO pay went up 40%. They're already millionaires. You know, it's shameful that, you know, one of- the one of the leaders of the- one of the corporations sitting in his second home in Acapulco, while we're bargaining rather than being at the bargaining table. And so, you know, our demands are just- we're asking for our fair share in this economy and the fruits of our labor.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So 21% is a no go for you?
SHAWN FAIN: It's definitely a no go. And we've made that very clear to the companies.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Ford's CEO said last November that electric vehicles are going to require 40% less labor to produce than combustion vehicles. I know what may not be the intention, but I wonder how you think this transition to electric vehicles may be eating away at your union's strength.
SHAWN FAIN: Well, I don't believe it's eating away at our union's strength. It is the way it is right now, unfortunately. This is- this is what's wrong with our economy and this is what's wrong with America right now. The billionaire class keeps taking more and more and the working class keeps getting left behind. And the unfortunate part in this transition right now, like always, go back to the- go back to the great recession. The banks got bailed out by our taxpayer dollars and they just kept on doing what they do while working class people's homes got foreclosed on. Go back to--
MARGARET BRENNAN: --Automakers got bailed out too.
SHAWN FAIN: Yes, automakers got bailed out.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And taxpayers lost money on that.
SHAWN FAIN: The workers were unfairly- the workers were unfairly blamed for everything that was wrong with those companies. It was bad- bad decisions on the parts of the companies that put us in that position. And the sad reality is, you know, the workers paid the price for that, we made all the- all the- all the sacrifices. And after a decade of massive profits, the workers have went backwards, our wages went backwards, our benefits have went backwards. The majority of our members have zero retirement security now. And well, meanwhile, it's insulting that a CEO gets on air this last- in the last few days and says that her $29 million salary is justified by her performance. No, it's not. It's justified by the performance of the worker, on the backs of the workers, and by paying them poverty wages. And that's unacceptable in this country.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I know, you've also said, though, it's a shell game to talk about, you know, CEOs handing back part of their money. You're talking about something that's more fundamental to the structure of this entire sector of the economy. And that's why I'm asking you about the transition, because many of the factories in this country that make batteries for those electric vehicles are not unionized. And that is where the White House is pushing the industry to go, more towards those electric vehicles. Is it- is that- isn't that part of this challenge for you leverage-wise?
SHAWN FAIN: So, the challenge is, you know, where we're going to go as a country, you know, again, I get back to this point. Our tax dollars are financing a massive portion of this transition to EV. We believe in a green economy. We have to have clean water, we have to have clean air. Anyone that doesn't believe global warming is happening isn't- isn't paying attention. But this transition has to be a just transition and a just transition means, if our tax dollars are going to finance this transition, then labor can't be left behind. And as it stands right now, the workers are being left behind. The companies want to talk about being competitive. It's not about being competitive. Competitive is the code word for race to the bottom. What they want is they want to pay us poverty wages, so they can keep on making billions more in profits. And they can keep enriching the shareholders and the CEOs and the corporate executives, while the workers pay the- pay the- pay the price for it and get left behind. That's got to stop in this country.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Ford has said that your demands would more than double the labor costs, which are already significantly higher than the labor costs at Tesla, at Toyota, and other foreign owned automakers who don't use union labor. So how do you make the case that these automakers need to keep investing in more expensive union shops rather than move to these Right-to-Work states?
SHAWN FAIN: First off, labor costs are about 5% of the cost of the vehicle. They could double our wages and not raise the price of the vehicles and still make billions in profits. It's a choice. And the fact that they want to compare it to how pitiful Tesla pays their workers and other companies pay their workers. That's what this whole argument's about. Workers in this country got to decide if they want a better life for themselves, instead of scraping to get by paycheck to paycheck, while everybody else walks away with the loot. And, you know, when we bargain good contracts- going back to the founding of this union, people join the UAW because we set the standard. People join unions because it's a better way of life. And that's what we got to do. We have to bargain a good contract. And then we're gonna go organize these places and bring these workers in so they get their fair share of the economy that they get nothing of right now. Most of these workers in those companies are scraping to get by so that greedy CEOs and greedy people like Elon Musk can build more rocket ships and shoot herself in outer space. And that's unacceptable.
MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden says he's the most pro-union president in American history, but you haven't endorsed him. What is it going to take for you to do that?
SHAWN FAIN: Our endorsements are going to be earned. We've been very clear about that, no matter what politician.
MARGARET BRENNAN: How does he earn it?
SHAWN FAIN: We expect action- we expect action, not words. And, you know, this- this fight we're in right now. I mean, obviously, you know, people are talking about them trying to interject themselves into our- into our negotiations. You know, this, this negotiating- our negotiators are fighting hard. Our leadership's fighting hard. It's going to be won at the negotiating table with our negotiating teams, with our members manning the picket lines and our allies out there. Who the president is now, who the former president was or the president before them isn't going to win this fight. This fight is all about one thing. It's about workers winning their fair share of economic justice instead of being left behind as they have been in the last decades.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be watching closely. Shawn, thank you for your time today."
72a3ed21-c3d5-465b-a470-16dfe6177738,"Biden CO2, Hydrogen Pipeline Dreams Get Wake-Up Call","The Energy Department faced a hard truth last month: Its aggressive plans to expand, and ideally retrofit, crude and natural gas pipelines to transport carbon emissions and blue hydrogen may be delayed.
“There are still a lot of challenges” in converting, building, and burying pipelines to accommodate CO2 and hydrogen, said Daniel Swanberg, energy practice leader in Houston for the global design and engineering company, Stantec STN , based in Edmonton, Alberta.
Swanberg was one of three-dozen energy experts from whom DOE Loan Programs Office chief Jigar Shah sought input about “carbon management” during a three-hour, closed-door workshop at S&P Global’s CERAWeek conference in Houston in March.

Carbon management was one of three DOE Deploy Dialogues during CERAWeek that was kept well under wraps.
The other two Dialogues assembled experts to discuss “clean hydrogen” and next-generation geothermal.
Deploy Dialogues is an offshoot series of industry workshops DOE developed from its Demonstrate Deploy Decarbonize 2023 “Deploy23” meeting last Fall. Deploy23 blended 500 federal, state, local, and tribal officials with executives from the broad energy ecosystem to discuss challenges and solutions in clean energy areas correspondent with DOE’s Liftoff reports. Dialogue recommendations will be folded into the Liftoff Reports.
A year ago, DOE launched Liftoff Reports, living documents that outline pathways to commercialization, taking innovation from research and development to deployment in seven areas: advanced nuclear, carbon management, clean hydrogen, industrial decarbonization, grid deployment, long duration energy storage, next-generation geothermal power, and virtual power plants.
During CERAWeek, DOE issued a Liftoff report on how to increase U.S. geothermal energy exponentially. Today, April 12, DOE will host a meeting to discuss that Liftoff report and plan.
During the carbon management Dialogue at CERAWeek, experts were divided into four breakout groups directed to dissect deployment, supply chain and scalability, financial realities, and barriers to build out pipeline infrastructure.
Carbon management turned out to be code for DOE’s interest in subsidizing transport infrastructure for carbon emissions from blue hydrogen production, and the hydrogen itself.
Late last year, the White House and DOE announced they would invest $7 billion into seven U.S. Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs (H2Hubs) to “accelerate the commercial-scale deployment of low-cost, clean hydrogen” for industrial processes, agriculture and power generation chiefly.
About two-thirds of DOE’s funding would advance green hydrogen projects. The other third would finance blue projects using a process called steam methane reforming which splits the molecule into hydrogen and carbon, combines the carbon with oxygen, and sequesters the CO2 gas underground.
Pipelines are needed to transport that CO2.

Swanberg, an expert on midstream operations, chose to be part of the transport segment to unearth realities around pipeline expansion.
Another breakout group looked at engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) of CCS infrastructure considering supply chain and scalability.
The group looked at whether EPC firms could graduate from conceptual design phases into procurement, construction and installation relatively quickly.
The breakout groups reunited for a larger discussion.
“Can our EPC firms handle it? Do they have the capacity, that’s a real issue and concern that was brought up,” Swanberg said.
Another breakout group looked at the financials, the break-even cost of a CCS project, and the return on investment based on DOE incentives.
Questions remain, such as the impact CO2 or hydrogen in a pipeline underground would have on the environment.
The EPA’s National Environmental Policy Act, how it comports with DOE’s goal to expand infrastructure, was also brought up as a question and concern.
“There are all these uncertainties,” Swanberg said. “No matter how much the push is from DOE, people are hesitant.”
During his session, Swanberg said there was no clarity about how to get landowners to allow for new or existing pipelines under or around their property.
“If you want the community, you’ve got to get the landowners. You’ve got to incentivize them. That’s the only way it’s going to take off.”
Landowners and farmers need to know what impact the pipelines will have on crops and livestock. There are also safety concerns that much be addressed in collaboration with communities impacted, he said.
“They know what natural gas is going to do. They know what crude is going to do,” but there are still questions when it comes to hydrogen and CO2 for local stakeholders, he said.
“There’s just a lot of uncertainty, but we have experts in the industry who are working to solve these challenges,” Swanberg added.
One issue raised during the discussion was federal oversight of hydrogen and CO2 pipelines.
The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials and Safety Administration oversees transport of hazardous materials, including hydrogen and carbon dioxide.

The Pipeline Safety Trust, a nonprofit education and advocacy organization commissioned a report two years ago citing regulatory shortfalls of CO2 pipelines. Out of more than 200,000 miles of hazardous liquid pipelines in the U.S., about 5,000 miles of pipes are used to transport CO2, and mostly for enhanced oil recovery.
The Trust said in its report, “Current federal safety regulations regulate only pipelines that transport supercritical CO2 containing over 90% carbon dioxide molecules, and not pipelines that ship CO2 in these other lower concentrations or forms, leaving a large regulatory gap…even the regulations for supercritical CO2 pipelines are incomplete or inadequate and place the public at great risk, especially from the tens of thousands of miles of CO2 pipelines that may be driven by CCS efforts.”
Two years later, in January 2024, Transportation officials told Congress that PHMSA had made research progress that could lead to regulatory progress.
PHMSA Deputy Administrator Tristan Brown told the House Energy and Commerce Committee that it is working through 12 active hydrogen transportation research projects from Fiscal 2021, 2022, and 2023 totaling about $11 million.
PHMSA is also working with DOE’s Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management to establish partnerships to research the safe pipeline transport of CO2.
PHMSA has four active projects to determine how to safely operate CO2 pipelines. The projects will examine the impact of leaks, leak detection methods, and the material quality of pipelines to see if they can be repurposed for underground storage facilities for CO2 transport and storage.
“The results of these may help inform a current rulemaking related to carbon dioxide pipelines,” Brown told House members.
“I could go in circles for hours and hours with all the gaps that I see,” that the government and institutional investors are not seeing in DOE’s push for pipelines, Swanberg said.
“We can figure it out from the financial, government level, how it works on paper, the business case. But none of that matters if you can’t move the product sustainably,” he said.
No feedback yet from Shah or his Dialogue team, which included: Noah Deich, DOE’s Deputy Assistant Secretary for Carbon Management in the Office of Fossil Energy; and Vanessa Chan, Chief Commercialization Officer and Director in DOE’s Office of Technology Transitions.
DOE was only in listening mode; The Department did not add anything to the discussion.
“They wanted us to have the debates,” Swanberg said.
The next Dialogue will be in early December 2024 in Washington, assuming a Biden victory in the presidential election in November.
“Interesting that the Loan Programs Office would be interested in pursuing pipelines in a proactive way given everything else that’s coming out of the administration,” said Matt Leggett, partner at Washington, D.C.-based K&L Gates GTES who runs the firm’s energy group.
President Biden began his term by killing the celebrated Keystone XL pipeline by denying TC Energy TRP a key permit. The controversial project was slated to transport Canadian crude to Texas.
Beyond Keystone, Leggett recalls all of the legal wrangling required to clear the way for the Mountain Valley Pipeline, which will carry natural gas from West Virginia to southern Virginia thanks to Senator Joe Manchin (D-WVa) who chairs the powerful Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
The Mountain Valley Pipeline took years to secure permits and environmental impact statements and nearly a year to build congressional consensus.
“There just seems to be this fundamental bias in terms of actual concrete meaningful impactful decisions where their true colors come out and they end up on the side of electrons and not on the side of molecules,” Leggett said.
“You see it in the LNG export pause. In the LNG export pause, it’s a very good microcosm for the divide in the Biden administration between the progressive environmentalists and the national security, energy security, diplomatic corps.”
Now, President Biden is ending his first term with an eye toward pipeline expansion."

FC Barcelona has been hit with a last minute double injury blow on the morning of its La Liga clash with Atletico Madrid as confirmed by the publishing of the squad list.
The Catalans travel to the Metropolitano on Sunday night, in what could be a preview for a potential Champions League semifinal clash later this spring.
Before the weekend, at an official draw in Switzerland, Barca was pitted against what Xavi Hernandez called ""one of the worst"" teams his men could hope to meet in Paris Saint-Germain.
At the same event, Atletico Madrid was also scheduled to face Borussia Dortmund with the winner of those two fixtures later meeting for a place in the final.
Barca can take courage to the Spanish capital considering it beat Atleti 1-0 at the Montjuic Stadium back in December.
On loan from the Rojiblancos, Joao Felix netted the only goal of the game and expects a hostile reception that will be ""worse"" for him than others in the late evening partidazo.
""I'm sure it's going to be a very difficult environment for the whole team. Of course it's going to be a little worse against me, but I'm a football player, I have to be used to this kind of thing,"" he told DAZN Espana on Friday.
""All of this motivates me more. I like these important matches, the matches that are spicy. I like that, it gives me extra motivation. It's going to be a very good game,"" Felix expects.
As has been confirmed on the morning of the match, however, Felix will line up without his fellow loanee and compatriot Joao Cancelo.
Providing cover for Alejandro Balde, as has been a constant since the turn of the year when the La Masia graduate had to undergo season-ending surgery, the Manchester City-owned star was expected to start in a back four with Pau Cubarsi, Ronald Araujo and Jules Kounde.
That won't be the case, however, with Marcos Alonso now included on the trip and a possible candidate to head straight into the starting XI.
Given the veteran's lack of freshness, however, it is more likely that Hector Fort is given a high-level assignment where success for the team can see Barca seal a second place berth in La Liga ahead of the international break.
Simultaneously, Ferran Torres has suffered another setback after again failing to make the squad despite Xavi stating he would complete a comeback from his late January knock this weekend."
0f5b6047-b5c8-4841-acd0-16edf714bda3,"Artificial intelligence is gaining state lawmakers' attention, and they have a lot of questions","As state lawmakers rush to get a handle on fast-evolving artificial intelligence technology, they're often focusing first on their own state governments before imposing restrictions on the private sector.
Legislators are seeking ways to protect constituents from discrimination and other harms while not hindering cutting-edge advancements in medicine, science, business, education and more.
""We're starting with the government. We're trying to set a good example,"" Connecticut state Sen. James Maroney said during a floor debate in May.
Connecticut plans to inventory all of its government systems using artificial intelligence by the end of 2023, posting the information online. And starting next year, state officials must regularly review these systems to ensure they won't lead to unlawful discrimination.
Maroney, a Democrat who has become a go-to AI authority in the General Assembly, said Connecticut lawmakers will likely focus on private industry next year. He plans to work this fall on model AI legislation with lawmakers in Colorado, New York, Virginia, Minnesota and elsewhere that includes ""broad guardrails"" and focuses on matters like product liability and requiring impact assessments of AI systems.
""It's rapidly changing and there's a rapid adoption of people using it. So we need to get ahead of this,"" he said in a later interview. ""We're actually already behind it, but we can't really wait too much longer to put in some form of accountability.""
Overall, at least 25 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia introduced artificial intelligence bills this year. As of late July, 14 states and Puerto Rico had adopted resolutions or enacted legislation, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The list doesn't include bills focused on specific AI technologies, such as facial recognition or autonomous cars, something NCSL is tracking separately.
Legislatures in Texas, North Dakota, West Virginia and Puerto Rico have created advisory bodies to study and monitor AI systems their respective state agencies are using, while Louisiana formed a new technology and cyber security committee to study AI's impact on state operations, procurement and policy. Other states took a similar approach last year.
Lawmakers want to know ""Who's using it? How are you using it? Just gathering that data to figure out what's out there, who's doing what,"" said Heather Morton, a legislative analysist at NCSL who tracks artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, privacy and internet issues in state legislatures. ""That is something that the states are trying to figure out within their own state borders.""
Connecticut's new law, which requires AI systems used by state agencies to be regularly scrutinized for possible unlawful discrimination, comes after an investigation by the Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic at Yale Law School determined AI is already being used to assign students to magnet schools, set bail and distribute welfare benefits, among other tasks. However, details of the algorithms are mostly unknown to the public.
AI technology, the group said, ""has spread throughout Connecticut's government rapidly and largely unchecked, a development that's not unique to this state.""
Richard Eppink, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Idaho, testified before Congress in May about discovering, through a lawsuit, the ""secret computerized algorithms"" Idaho was using to assess people with developmental disabilities for federally funded health care services. The automated system, he said in written testimony, included corrupt data that relied on inputs the state hadn't validated.
AI can be shorthand for many different technologies, ranging from algorithms recommending what to watch next on Netflix to generative AI systems such as ChatGPT that can aid in writing or create new images or other media. The surge of commercial investment in generative AI tools has generated public fascination and concerns about their ability to trick people and spread disinformation, among other dangers.
Some states haven't attempted to tackle the issue yet. In Hawaii, state Sen. Chris Lee, a Democrat, said lawmakers didn't pass any legislation this year governing AI ""simply because I think at the time, we didn't know what to do.""
Instead, the Hawaii House and Senate passed a resolution Lee proposed that urges Congress to adopt safety guidelines for the use of artificial intelligence and limit its application in the use of force by police and the military.
Lee, vice-chair of the Senate Labor and Technology Committee, said he hopes to introduce a bill in next year's session that is similar to Connecticut's new law. Lee also wants to create a permanent working group or department to address AI matters with the right expertise, something he admits is difficult to find.
""There aren't a lot of people right now working within state governments or traditional institutions that have this kind of experience,"" he said.
The European Union is leading the world in building guardrails around AI. There has been discussion of bipartisan AI legislation in Congress, which Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in June would maximize the technology's benefits and mitigate significant risks.
Yet the New York senator did not commit to specific details. In July, President Joe Biden announced his administration had secured voluntary commitments from seven U.S. companies meant to ensure their AI products are safe before releasing them.
Maroney said ideally the federal government would lead the way in AI regulation. But he said the federal government can't act at the same speed as a state legislature.
""And as we've seen with the data privacy, it's really had to bubble up from the states,"" Maroney said.
Some state-level bills proposed this year have been narrowly tailored to address specific AI-related concerns. Proposals in Massachusetts would place limitations on mental health providers using AI and prevent ""dystopian work environments"" where workers don't have control over their personal data. A proposal in New York would place restrictions on employers using AI as an ""automated employment decision tool"" to filter job candidates.
North Dakota passed a bill defining what a person is, making it clear the term does not include artificial intelligence. Republican Gov. Doug Burgum, a long-shot presidential contender, has said such guardrails are needed for AI but the technology should still be embraced to make state government less redundant and more responsive to citizens.
In Arizona, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoed legislation that would prohibit voting machines from having any artificial intelligence software. In her veto letter, Hobbs said the bill ""attempts to solve challenges that do not currently face our state.""
In Washington, Democratic Sen. Lisa Wellman, a former systems analyst and programmer, said state lawmakers need to prepare for a world in which machine systems become ever more prevalent in our daily lives.
She plans to roll out legislation next year that would require students to take computer science to graduate high school.
""AI and computer science are now, in my mind, a foundational part of education,"" Wellman said. ""And we need to understand really how to incorporate it.""

bdb48f06-0662-45dd-b053-1ddd70f3a718,Welcome to the 'Hotel California' case: The trial over handwritten lyrics to an Eagles classic,"The uncomfortable mix of art and commerce behind the tense partnership of the Eagles' Glenn Frey and Don Henley 2007: Glenn Frey and Don Henley on 60 Minutes 02:31
In the mid-1970s, the Eagles were working on a spooky, cryptic new song.
On a lined yellow pad, Don Henley, with input from band co-founder Glenn Frey, jotted thoughts about ""a dark desert highway"" and ""a lovely place"" with a luxurious surface and ominous undertones. And something on ice, perhaps caviar or Taittinger — or pink Champagne?
The song, ""Hotel California,"" became one of rock's most indelible singles. And nearly a half-century later, those handwritten pages of lyrics-in-the-making have become the center of an unusual criminal trial set to open Wednesday.
Rare-book dealer Glenn Horowitz, former Rock & Roll Hall of Fame curator Craig Inciardi and memorabilia seller Edward Kosinski are charged with conspiring to own and try to sell manuscripts of ""Hotel California"" and other Eagles hits without the right to do so.
The three have pleaded not guilty, and their lawyers have said the men committed no crime with the papers, which they acquired via a writer who'd worked with the Eagles. But the Manhattan district attorney's office says the defendants connived to obscure the documents' disputed ownership, despite knowing that Henley said the pages were stolen.
Clashes over valuable collectibles abound, but criminal trials like this are rare. Many fights are resolved in private, in lawsuits or with agreements to return the items.
""If you can avoid a prosecution by handing over the thing, most people just hand it over,"" said Travis McDade, a University of Illinois law professor who studies rare document disputes.
Of course, the case of the Eagles manuscripts is distinctive in other ways, too.
The prosecutors' star witness is indeed that: Henley is expected to testify between Eagles tour stops. The non-jury trial could offer a peek into the band's creative process and life in the fast lane of '70s stardom.
At issue are over 80 pages of draft lyrics from the blockbuster 1976 ""Hotel California"" album, including words to the chart-topping, Grammy-winning title cut. It features one of classic rock's most recognizable riffs, best-known solos and most oft-quoted — arguably overquoted — lines: ""You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.""
Henley has said the song is about ""the dark underbelly of the American dream.""
It still was streamed over 220 million times and got 136,000 radio spins last year in the U.S. alone, according to the entertainment data company Luminate. The ""Hotel California"" album has sold 26 million copies nationwide over the years, bested only by an Eagles' greatest hits disc and Michael Jackson's ""Thriller.""
The pages also include lyrics from songs including ""Life in the Fast Lane"" and ""New Kid in Town."" Eagles manager Irving Azoff has called the documents ""irreplaceable pieces of musical history.""
Horowitz, Inciardi and Kosinki are charged with conspiracy to possess stolen property and various other offenses.
They're not charged with actually stealing documents. Nor is anyone else, but prosecutors will still have to establish that the documents were stolen. The defense maintains that's not true.
Much turns on the Eagles' interactions with Ed Sanders, a writer who also co-founded the 1960s counterculture rock band the Fugs. He worked in the late '70s and early '80s on an authorized Eagles biography that was never published.
Sanders isn't charged in the case. A phone message seeking comment was left for him.
He sold the pages to Horowitz, who then sold them to Inciardi and Kosinski.
Horowitz has handled huge rare book and archive deals, and he's been entangled in some ownership spats before. One involved papers linked to ""Gone With the Wind"" author Margaret Mitchell. It was settled.
Inciardi worked on notable exhibitions for the Cleveland-based Rock Hall of Fame. Kosinski has been a principal in Gotta Have It! Collectibles, known for auctioning celebrities' personal possessions — so personal that Madonna unsuccessfully sued to try to stop a sale that included her latex briefs.
Henley told a grand jury he never gave the biographer the lyrics, according to court filings from Kosinski's lawyers. But defense lawyers have signaled that they plan to probe Henley's memory of the time.
""We believe that Mr. Henley voluntarily provided the lyrics to Mr. Sanders,"" attorney Scott Edelman said in court last week.
Sanders told Horowitz in 2005 that while working on the Eagles book, he was sent whatever papers he wanted from Henley's home in Malibu, California, according to the indictment.
Then Kosinski's business offered some pages at auction in 2012. Henley's attorneys came knocking. And Horowitz, Inciardi and Sanders, in varying combinations, began batting around alternate versions of the manuscripts' provenance, the indictment says.
In one story, Sanders found the pages discarded in a backstage dressing room. In others, he got them from a stage assistant or while amassing ""a lot of material related to the Eagles from different people."" In yet another, he obtained them from Frey — an account that ""would make this go away once and for all,"" Horowitz suggested in 2017. Frey had died the year before.
""He merely needs gentle handling and reassurance that he's not going to the can,"" Horowitz emailed Inciardi during a 2012 exchange about getting Sanders' ""'explanation' shaped into a communication"" to auctioneers, the indictment says.
Sanders supplied or signed off on some of the varying explanations, according to the indictment, and it's unclear what he may have conveyed verbally. But he apparently rejected at least the dressing-room tale.
Kosinki forwarded one explanation, approved by Sanders, to Henley's lawyer. Kosinski also assured Sotheby's auction house that the musician had ""no claim"" to the documents and asked to keep potential bidders in the dark about Henley's complaints, the indictment says.
Sotheby's listed the ""Hotel California"" song lyrics in a 2016 auction but withdrew them after learning the ownership was in question. Sotheby's isn't charged in the case and declined to comment.
Henley bought some draft lyrics privately from Gotta Have It! for $8,500 in 2012, when he also began filing police reports, according to court filings.
Defense lawyers claim Henley found starstruck prosecutors to take up his cause instead of pursuing a civil suit himself.
The DA's office worked closely with Henley's legal team, and an investigator even yearned for backstage passes for an Eagles show — until a prosecutor said the idea was ""completely inappropriate,"" Kosinki's lawyers said in court papers.
Prosecutors have rebuffed questions about their motivations as ""a conspiracy theory rather than a legal defense.""
Last year, they wrote in court papers, ""It is the defendants, not the prosecutors, who are on trial."""

British chip designer Arm’s stock rallied Tuesday to its highest level since it began trading in September, riding the wave of optimism surrounding generative artificial intelligence to a rare win for recent initial public offerings on the stock market.

Key Facts
Shares of Arm gained as much as 2.4% to $74 Tuesday, outpacing modest gains from the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq during low-volume trading during the holiday week. Arm’s rise came after Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann bumped his price target for the stock from $85 to $110, implying nearly 50% upside from Arm’s current share price. In a brief note to clients, Mosesmann cited Arm’s accelerating “generative AI class design/licensing momentum” as a justification for higher earnings potential for Arm, which primarily makes money by hawking semiconductor chip designs to technology giants like Apple and Nvidia, though critics suggest Arm’s exposure to AI is far lower than some believe. Shares of Arm are now up more than 30% from their September 14 IPO price of $51, and are up about 12% from their intraday debut peak of $66.
Surprising Fact
Arm stock’s rally coincided with strong returns for the tech sector, but came amid a far bleaker stretch for other notably companies which went public this year. Johnson & Johnson spinoff Kenvue (down 3% from IPO price, down 21% from debut intraday high), German sandal purveyor Birkenstock (up 5%, up 13%), AI-based marketer Klaviyo (down 5%, down 27%) and grocery delivery heavyweight Instacart (down 20%, down 44%) have all underperformed Arm thus far.
Key Background
Arm became the most valuable company to go public in nearly two years when it began trading on the Nasdaq in September, helping restart a limping IPO market. The company was previously publicly traded between 1998 and 2016, going private last decade after Japan’s SoftBank acquired the company at a $32 billion valuation. SoftBank retained about a 90% stake in Arm following the chip architect’s recent IPO, scoring a strong paper win in the transaction as Arm’s market capitalization stands at about $75 billion. Nvidia, which has added nearly $900 billion in market value this year due to the AI boom, actually agreed to buy Arm for $40 billion in 2020, before backing off the acquisition in February 2022 following regulatory scrutiny.

Washington — Nearly twenty years have passed since the expiration of the federal assault weapons ban, and Wednesday's mass shooting near the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl parade — which killed one person and injured nearly two dozen others — has again brought the debate around U.S. gun laws front and center.
Some survivors of recent mass shootings are throwing their support behind the Go Safe Act, legislation sponsored by Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico that would effectively ban gas powered semi-automatic firearms and large-capacity magazines capable of holding more than 10-rounds.
Michael Anderson was pouring a drink at Club Q in Colorado Springs when shots rang out in November 2022.
""The rapid firing of bullets from a high-powered weapons, that's a sound you'll never get out of your head,"" Anderson told CBS News.
Anderson was the only surviving bartender in the mass shooting at Club Q, a popular LGBTQ bar, in which five people were killed and 17 more wounded, including Anderson.
The gunman pleaded guilty in state court to five counts of murder and 46 counts of attempted murder. He is also facing federal hate crime charges.
Natalie Grumet was shot in the face during the Las Vegas massacre, shattering her jawbone and fracturing her chin in half. She says he has since had ""over a dozen"" surgeries.
Sixty people were killed and hundreds more wounded when a gunman opened fire from a suite in the Mandalay Bay hotel room onto a crowd during an outdoor country music festival on the Las Vegas Strip in October 2017 — the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.
""I wake up in pain and I go to bed in pain, and emotional recovery is just as challenging,"" Grumet said.
Melissa Alexander, a gun owner and Republican, says she wants ""to be a voice for that group of people that sometimes I don't think you hear from.""
Alexander is the mother of a 9-year-old survivor of the Nashville elementary school shooting in March 2023 which killed three children and three adults.
""The more these types of tragedies happen, the more people will be activated,"" Alexander said. ""There's going to be an inflection point. Like, we can't go on like this as a society.""
Garnell Whitfield Jr.'s 86-year-old mother, Ruth Whitfield, was among 10 people killed by a white supremacist in a racially-motivated shooting at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, in May 2022.
""You know, that inflection point for me is not going to bring my mother back,"" Whitfield said.
Now, fed up with gridlock, this group of mass shooting survivors and family members of shooting victims are meeting with lawmakers to rally support for Heinrich's Go Safe Act.
""I really wanted to get at the mechanisms, the specific mechanisms that make some of these weapons so dangerous,"" Heinrich told CBS News.
The semi-automatic weapons targeted by the bill are behind nine of the 10 deadliest shootings since 2016.
Heinrich's bill is supported by mass shooting survivors and March Fourth, a nonpartisan organization with a single mission of reinstating the ban.
Between 2015 and 2022, mass shootings carried out with assault weapons left an average of nearly six-times as many people shot as shootings without assault weapons, according to Everytown, a gun safety advocacy group.
""I think that people wanna think like this it is like a left or right issue,"" Grumet said. And I think we all know that sitting here, there's a lot of things going on that need to change, and you have to start somewhere.""
""It starts with us,"" Grumet said.
""D.C. should take notes because we're all very different, from different parts of this country,"" Anderson added. ""But we're here united on this, and eventually we will get the change we need and deserve."""
cd1f38ac-bf78-4d70-b2ef-57b966a0a1bc,Report: Attacks on Churches Increased 800% in 6 Years,"Attacks on churches have increased nearly 800 percent in less than six years, indicating that “hostility against U.S. churches is not only on the rise but also accelerating,” a Family Research Council (FRC) report found.
Between 2018 and 2023, FRC identified 915 acts of hostility against churches in the United States by analyzing open-source documents, reports, and media outlets. In just the last year alone (between January and November of 2023), 436 acts of hostility against churches occurred, according to the report.
“This was more than double the number of incidents in all 12 months of 2022, which was 195. It also marked the second consecutive year that saw more than twice the number of incidents of the year before,” the report states. “There were at least 96 incidents in 2021, 55 in 2020, 83 in 2019, and 50 in 2018. Over the entire reporting period for this report, from 2018 to 2023, acts of hostility appear to have increased in frequency over time”
The report notes that the increase “could be due in part to increased public reporting on crimes against churches, resulting in more available data than in the past.”
By category, 315 attacks in 2023 were vandalisms, 75 were arson attacks or arson attempts, ten were gun-related, 20 were bomb threats, and 37 fell in the “other” category. Seventeen incidents fell into multiple categories, according to the report.
Between 2018 and 2023, there were at least 709 occurrences of vandalism, 135 arson attacks or attempts, 22 gun-related incidents, 32 bomb threats, and 61 other incidents (assault, threats, interruption of worship services, etc.). In 39 cases, multiple types of hostility occurred (e.g., vandalism and arson), the report states.
The incidents occurred in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, although states with larger populations tended to report more incidents.

Hostility against churches is on the rise in the United States. -2023 (Jan-Nov) saw a significant increase in acts of hostility against churches; we identified 436 incidents. -This was more than double the number of incidents in all 12 months of 2022, which was… pic.twitter.com/klWe6X45vj — Family Research Council (@FRCdc) February 20, 2024
According to the FRC, the motives of most of incidents are unknown, although many attacks had political overtones and several were overtly Satanic. At least 59 of the churches in the report were repeat victims with verifiable timeframes of the incidents, according to the FRC.
“Some acts of vandalism against churches appeared to have been motivated by anger toward the targeted church. Other acts appeared to have a political motivation. Some incidents appeared to have been committed by juveniles or persons struggling with mental illness,” the report states. “Several instances of vandalism also involved theft. Many acts of vandalism against churches were under criminal investigation; a minority were under investigation as hate crimes. Police were often unable to identify the vandals.”
The longest section of the report is a 97-page list of attacks on churches, which are corroborated by 50 pages of endnotes.
Standout cases include several incidents of transgender violence against churches. The most shocking incident was the March 27 shooting at Nashville Covenant School. Trans-identifying Audrey Hale reportedly shot and killed six people, including three young students. Hale, who went by the male name “Aiden,” left behind a manifesto, most of which law enforcement refused to release, although a few pages were leaked.

The report lists another attack on January 3, 2023, by a man named Cameron Storer who identifies as a female. Storer is accused of setting fire to Portland Korean Church, a 117-year-old historic vacant building. Storer told investigators that he heard voices telling him to burn the church down.
On March 3, 2023, St. Joseph Catholic Church in Louisville, Kentucky, was vandalized with the painted message: “TRANS PWR.” The incident occurred after the state legislature overrode the Democrat governor’s veto of a bill that protects minors for sex mutilating surgeries.

A number of incidents were linked to pro-abortion hostility after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. And “at least 12 incidents included satanic imagery or symbols,” the report notes, listing several examples.
The FRC said it “set out to analyze publicly available data to better understand the problem and determine whether there has been a statistically significant increase over time” due to “the perceived increased in acts of hostility against churches in the United States.” The FRC released the February report following a similar report on incidents that occurred between January 2018 and September 2022.
The FRC said the report is not comprehensive and that “many acts of hostility against churches are likely not reported to authorities and/or are not featured in the news or other online sources from which we collected data.”
“Thus, the number of acts of hostility is undoubtedly much higher than the number reflected in this report. This report is intended to compile the publicly reported data and identify any trends,” the report states.
Author of the report Arielle Del Turco noted that while the motivations of many attacks are unknown, “the rise in crimes against churches is taking place in a context in which American culture appears increasingly hostile to Christianity.” She wrote:
Criminal acts of vandalism and destruction of church property may be symptomatic of a collapse in societal reverence and respect for houses of worship and religion—in this case, churches and Christianity Americans appear increasingly comfortable lashing out against church buildings, pointing to a larger societal problem of marginalizing core Christian beliefs, including those that touch on hot-button political issues related to human dignity and sexuality. Attacks on houses of worship may also signal a discomfort with religion in general.
“The free exercise of religion has always been an essential component of American society and is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution as a basic right,” she added. “Attempts to prevent religious exercise through threats or violence should be soundly condemned by anyone who values the First Amendment.”

17be6e2e-850d-4c2b-a740-8534cc1eb01f,Former Michigan gubernatorial candidate Ryan Kelley sentenced to 2 months behind bars,"A federal judge on Tuesday sentenced a former Republican candidate for Michigan governor to two months behind bars for joining a mob's Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, where he riled up other rioters and ripped a tarp outside the building.
Ryan Kelley, who finished fourth in a primary field of five Republican gubernatorial candidates last year, pleaded guilty in July to a misdemeanor for his role in the siege.
Several months before his guilty plea, Kelley posted on social media that the Capitol riot was an FBI ""set up."" His campaign posted the words ""political prisoner"" on Facebook after his June 2022 arrest.
U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper told Kelley that he misused his platform as a candidate for public office by promoting lies about election fraud, including the baseless claim that Jan. 6 was somehow part of an FBI plot.
""A lot of folks voted for you. A lot of folks followed you,"" Cooper said before sentencing Kelley to 60 days of imprisonment and ordering him to pay a $5,000 fine.
Kelley, 42, traveled from Allendale, Michigan, to Washington, D.C., to attend then-President Donald Trump's ""Stop the Steal"" rally near the White House on Jan. 6. Kelley told the judge that he wanted to see ""receipts"" supporting Trump's claims that Democrats stole the 2020 presidential election from him, the Republican incumbent.
""Those receipts never came,"" he said. ""That is a betrayal, and I was misled into believing those things.""
But he said he doesn't blame Trump for his conduct on Jan. 6.
""He did invite us there, but my actions were my actions,"" Kelley said.
Kelley, a real estate broker, isn't accused of engaging in violence on Jan. 6. But federal prosecutors said he helped breach scaffolding, stirred up the mob with his shouts and gestured for other rioters to move closer to the Capitol and to police officers guarding the building.
Kelley pleaded guilty to entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, a charge punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of one year.
Prosecutors recommended sentencing Kelley to three months of incarceration.
""Mr. Kelley engaged in not just a bad decision but a series of bad decisions that day,"" a prosecutor, Shanai Watson, said.
Kelley's arrest roiled what was already a complicated Republican primary for the governor's race. Conservative commentator Tudor Dixon won the Republican primary but ultimately lost to incumbent Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, last November.
Kelley spoke at a ""Stop the Steal"" rally at the state Capitol in Lansing in November 2020, shortly after the presidential election. Kelley urged others at the rally to ""stand and fight, with the goal of preventing Democrats from stealing the election,"" the FBI said.
After attending Trump's rally on Jan. 6, he marched to the Capitol and joined a crowd that formed on the West Plaza, where flash bang grenades exploded near him.
Kelley and other rioters climbed through scaffolding covered by a white tarp. Surveillance video captured him tearing the tarp.
""Even though his rip of the tarp was relatively modest, it extended an already existing hole in the tarp and widened the opening through which some rioters advanced on the Capitol Building,"" prosecutors wrote in a court filing.
Kelley remained on Capitol grounds for nearly two hours but isn't accused of entering the building that day.
""Mr. Kelley understands and appreciates that he never should have participated in the protests that turned into a riot that day and that such violence has no place in our democracy,"" his defense lawyer wrote.
At a debate last year, Kelley said the riot was ""a First Amendment activity by a majority of those people, myself included.""
""We were there protesting the government because we don't like the results of the 2020 election, the process of how it happened. And we have that First Amendment right. And that's what 99% of the people were there for that day,"" he said.
In a court filing after the primary loss, Kelley's lawyers said was ""still actively involved in political issues throughout the state of Michigan, and is contemplating whether he will run for a different state or federal position.""
Defense attorney Gary Springstead said on Tuesday that Kelley ""wants nothing to do with politics at this point."" Kelley told the judge that he wants to focus on his business and his family.
More than 1,100 people have been charged with Capitol riot-related federal crimes. More than 800 of them have pleaded guilty or been convicted by a jury or judge after contested trials. Nearly 700 of them have been sentenced, with roughly two-thirds receiving terms of imprisonment ranging from three days to 22 years.
Also on Tuesday, a woman who smashed a window at the Capitol and used a bullhorn to direct other rioters on Jan. 6 was sentenced to four years and nine months in prison. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth also ordered Rachel Marie Powell to pay restitution and a fine totaling nearly $8,000.
In July, Lamberth heard testimony without a jury before he convicted Powell of all nine counts in her indictment. A prosecutor has said Powell, 41, of Sandy Lake, Pennsylvania, played a ""leading role"" during the riot."

The second, third and fourth picks in this year's draft will also earn $76,535 their first year, according to the league's collective bargaining agreement. The base annual pay for all four athletes will see only a modest rise over the next few years — $78,066 in 2025, $85,873 in 2026 and $97,582 in 2027.
Lower-ranked WNBA draft picks earn less, according to a wage scale outlined in the players' agreement with the league. Players are also eligible for bonuses at the end of the season, based on performance. For example, the ""Rookie of the Year"" award comes with a $5,150 bonus.
The WNBA did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment on how it sets athlete salaries.
Clark's earnings are not limited to her WNBA salary. She's expected to sign sponsorship deals that will likely lead to her earning far more than than the five figures she'll get for playing basketball. Already, her name image and likeness is valued at $3 million, a figure that's expected to grow, while she has already done TV commercials for advertisers including Gatorade, State Farm and Nike.
Still, Clark's base pay pales in comparison to her counterparts in the NBA. Rookie Victor Wembanyama, the first pick in last year's NBA draft, made more than $12 million for the 2023-24 season, his first year in the NBA, according to Spotrac, a site tracking sports statistics.Her salary is roughly equivalent to that of a first-year or junior New York-based attorney at a national law firm, according to a posting on job site Indeed.
With some online commentators expressing surprise at Clark's pay, President Biden weighed in Tuesday on the issue of pay disparity in sports.
""Women in sports continue to push new boundaries and inspire us all. But right now we're seeing that even if you're the best, women are not paid their fair share,"" he said in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter). ""It's time that we give our daughters the same opportunities as our sons and ensure women are paid what they deserve.""
To be sure, what female athletes ""deserve"" is up for debate. The NBA was founded decades ago and generates billions of dollars annually. The WNBA, by contrast, was launched in 1996 and is far smaller, generating an estimated $200 million in revenue annually, according to a report from Just Women's Sports.
On the issue of compensation for individual players, ""There isn't an endless reservoir of money they get to deal with,"" Greg Bouris, a professor sports management at Adelphi University, told CBS MoneyWatch, adding that the WNBA needs to meaningfully grow its revenue in order for player salaries to increase. ""It comes down to economics.""
And as big of a star as Clark has been for college basketball, she remains untested in the professional arena, he noted. That's part of the reason why both the NBA and WNBA issue caps on rookie salaries.
""They are coming in to play against the best basketball players in the world and they have yet to prove themselves,"" Bouris said. ""Sucess at one level doesn't guarantee success at the other.""
By the same token, Clark is expected to add considerable sizzle to the league, as she did in helping the women's NCAA tournament draw a larger TV audience than the men.
""She's going to raise all boats""
""She's coming in with all of this momentum in earned media coverage for the WNBA, so the league has an opportunity to capitalize on that. She's having a tremendous economic impact,"" Bouris said. ""She's going to raise all boats.""
The Women's Sports Foundation, an advocacy group for women in sports founded by tennis legend Billie Jean King, has pointed to the relatively low pay in the WNBA as a reason why top players often compete overseas during the U.S. league's off season to supplement their salaries. That includes WNBA star Brittney Griner, who was jailed in Russia while playing there and who previously noted in an interview that ""the whole reason a lot of us go over is the pay gap.""
The WNBA has made strides in promoting pay equity in recent years. While NBA players collectively receive roughly 50% of the league's revenue, WNBA players previously took home less than 23%. But that figure jumped to 50% under the latest labor deal with the league.
Yet the pay gap in professional basketball and most other sports remains, with only female tennis players achieving a measure of equity. In the NBA, the minimum rookie salary for the 2022-23 season was $953,000, according to Spotrac.
Ketra Armstrong, a professor of sports management at Michigan University said that while she views Clark as underpaid relative to their skills, so are many WNBA athletes.
""It's a structural issue, and you can't look at salaries in isolation or compare them to how much the men make because there are stark differences there,"" Armstrong told CBS MoneyWatch in noting the enormous revenues the NBA generates, compared with the WNBA.
The upshot: For WNBA players' salaries to increase, the league will have to land bigger broadcast deals, secure more lucrative corporate sponsorships, and sell more tickets and merchandise. But Armstrong identified the current moment as a potential turning point for the league.
""The Caitlin Clark impact is real. There is an energy and vibrance touching the WNBA in ways it never has before,"" she said. ""If we can get a groundswell increase in ticket sales for all WNBA teams, more merchandise sales, more media exposure, and more people investing, we'll start to see movement in revenue."""
545f552c-bb57-48d2-a8eb-0211ec4434c3,Mayor Adams claims NYC is back and a paradise,"Eric Adams is trying to con us into believing New York City “is thriving.” Sorry, Mr. Mayor, but we’re not wearing rose-colored glasses.
On Sunday, Adams spoke at a brunch for New York Sun founders at the American Hotel in tony Sag Harbor. He said, “The city is not coming back. We’re back back.”
Apparently he thinks his job is public relations, not actually solving the city’s problems.
A Siena College poll shows more New York state voters disapprove than approve of Adams’ response to the migrant crisis.
So what does the mayor do?
Last week he launched a highly coordinated social-media campaign, requiring all 20 city agencies to tweet out a message applauding New York City’s welcoming of migrants. “New York remains a beacon for all who come to our shores.”
The propaganda blitz, paid for by tax dollars, praises the “brave New Yorkers ready to help,” including the mayor, of course. It’s a slap in the face to New Yorkers already footing most of the bill for the crisis.
Adams dished more PR spin at Sunday’s breakfast. Here’s a taste:
There are only two kinds of Americans, “those who live in New York and those who wish they could.”
New York residents are fed up of migrant shelters popping up in their neighborhoods, demanding an end to it. ZUMAPRESS.com/Bruce Cotler
Reality check: The city is going from Big Apple to shrunken apple, losing population massively. Some 400,000 people fled during 2020 and 2021, and in 2022 Manhattan was the only borough that did not lose population.
Worse, 158 financial firms have moved their headquarters out of New York City since 2019, taking nearly $1 trillion in managed assets with them.
Adams just returned from a whirlwind three-day trip to Israel, in part to attract business.
Why not keep the businesses already here?
Last year, financial firms paid $5.4 billion in New York taxes and accounted for nearly a quarter of all personal income-tax collections.
Taxpayers are leaving, and migrants who consume tax dollars are flooding in.
The media hype about crime in Times Square “is not the reality.” He added, “People are out dining, dating, eating, enjoying the beauty of what this city has to offer.”
Reality check: Times Square is overrun with junkies smoking crack pipes, drug dealers selling within view of cops, the homeless sprawled out and migrants loitering aimlessly.
In the last two years, major crime has skyrocketed 50% in the NYPD’s Midtown South precinct, which includes Times Square, Madison Square Garden, Grand Central Station and Port Authority Bus Terminal.
“There is no disorder,” Adams insisted. He claimed the city feels safe and orderly.
Reality check: Petty crime, including shoplifting, is soaring.
The subways are what New York Post columnist Steve Cuozzo calls a “rolling lunatic asylum.”
Subway crimes continue to happen, even though Adams implemented more officers to monitor underground activity. Christopher Sadowski
Car thefts, illegal drug-dealing and fare beating are out of control. The mayor should be empowering the newly appointed NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban to crack down on small crimes because these send a dangerous message that anything will be tolerated.
On the migrant crisis, the immediate remedy is “allowing people to work.” Adamssaid, “They’re professionals, they’re writers, they’re journalists, they’re in medical professions. We have a shortage of nurses.” Adams added. “We were given a gift; we now need to manage that gift.”
Reality check: That’s crazy talk.
Instead of having the backbone to tell President Biden to close the border, Adams and fellow Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul are using work authorization as a political default position.
Gov. Kathy Hochul defends the influx of migrants in New York, claiming there is enough work for locals and migrants. AP/Hans Pennink
Hochul claims there are roughly 460,000 job openings in the state, more than enough for every migrant seeking work.
All that’s needed is for Biden to cut the red tape on work authorizations.
The nutty assumption is that a migrant can fill any job.
Data on the latest newcomers are not available, but according to Pew, most migrants do not speak English and do not have higher education.
California needs farm workers. New York needs hospitality workers. But beyond that, job openings are in nursing, software development and computer support, per Hechinger Report and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Migrants are not job-ready for these positions.
Finally, Adams confessed to the audience: “This is going to be a retrospectively appreciated administration.”
Reality check: Meanwhile, New Yorkers suffer.
Tell Mayor Adams to dispense with the PR. No one is fooled. Start governing."
704a6595-cddb-427f-9074-77f75756e715,15 Questions To Ask Your CMO About Integrating AI In Marketing,"getty
With artificial intelligence gaining more and more popularity in business, it can be easy for companies to quickly jump on the AI bandwagon without first considering the pros and cons of making such a move. This is especially true for marketing—a department that specializes in creating the company’s brand voice and messaging in such a way that will connect with consumers. Would implementing AI compromise that specialty?
This is just one of the many questions CEOs should discuss with their company’s chief marketing officer to determine if integrating AI into their marketing efforts is the right move. Below, the marketing experts of Forbes Communications Council explore 15 other questions CEOs should ask their CMOs, and why doing so is crucial to their success.
1. 'Can we trust it?'
This is the question that should be asked first, followed by, ""Is it worth the risk to our brand?"" There is still so much unknown and not vetted about AI that it may not be the smartest move to run out and be a frontiersman right away. There is wisdom in sitting back a little and looking smarter for allowing other brands to experience the early errors instead of yours. - Kathleen Stockham, South College
2. 'How will we be different?'
The advent of AI will lead to more marketing clutter and make it more difficult for a company's message to break through. So, it will be vital for a brand to present a unique message that resonates with customers. Whether this is done with AI or by doubling down on a handcrafted approach, a company must offer a compelling brand personality in order to win business. - Robert Neely, Lima One Capital
3. 'What is the risk?'
While AI can provide numerous benefits, it can also place the organization in jeopardy if it is used without guardrails. A CEO should understand what processes are in place to combat AI’s tendency to mimic biases in the data it analyzes, to safeguard customer privacy and to ensure that an AI vendor’s cybersecurity practices are in line with their own as a means of protecting IP. - Joe Garber, Axiad
4. 'Is it saving time or bringing value?'
Ask, “Are you using AI to save time or bring value, and do you know the difference?” For example, one of our brand pillars is subtle luxury. It doesn’t align well with massive amounts of AI-generated content. A better use case that aligns with our values is using AI for forecasting. In this case, a CEO can ask, “Are you using AI to ensure campaign success and better understand pipeline contribution?” - Courtney Austermehle, Constructor
5. 'What data-driven insights will it provide to help us market to customers?'
AI should help brands better understand their customers, which empowers their marketing to evolve and revolve around the customer. Marketing AI's purpose is to help tailor marketing strategies, improve personalization and, ultimately, drive more effective customer engagement. - Pini Yakuel, Optimove
6. 'How should we position our AI use in customer messaging?'
Much of the AI focus in marketing has been on driving productivity in research, ideation or creation. Companies need to do better in positioning and messaging how their product uses AI to customers. The claim to be ""AI-driven"" is astronomical and empty. CEOs should ask their CMOs, ""How should we be positioning our use of AI in our product portfolio and then messaging this to our customers?"" - Rekha Thomas, Path Forward Marketing LLC
7. 'How will it help make marketing operations more efficient?'
CEOs should be asking their CMOs how integrating AI in marketing will help to make marketing operations more efficient. Boosting marketing ROI by lowering marketing costs is something that CEOs (and CFOs) are often focused on. In a time when marketing resources are increasingly under pressure, CMOs need to demonstrate how integrating AI can maximize the return on marketing investment. - Kerry-Ann Betton Stimpson, JMMB Group
8. 'How does this reflect our readiness to embrace innovation while managing risks?'
CEOs need to probe their CMOs on how their approach to AI in marketing reflects their readiness to embrace innovation while managing potential risks. It's crucial to ensure that AI's adoption is not just about jumping on a bandwagon but instead about making informed decisions that align with the company's growth trajectory and brand integrity over varying time frames. - Kurt Uhlir, Ethereal Innovations, Inc.
Forbes Communications Council is an invitation-only community for executives in successful public relations, media strategy, creative and advertising agencies. Do I qualify?
9. 'Is our AI usage under control?'
AI can be a huge efficiency booster, but it can also get out of control and lead to embarrassing situations, with rogue content slipping out the door. Any good marketing organization experiments with new technologies, but policies and controls need to be put in place to make sure any use of AI in work products is reviewed, quality-checked and approved before release. - Tom Treanor, Snipp Interactive
10. 'What is the impact on the business and on the customer?'
AI use needs to help the customer. Can we give the information to the customer faster and in a more timely manner, as well as help them interact with the brand and get everything they need? From the business side, does it help achieve the business objectives of customer satisfaction, growth, profitability and more? - Gaurav Bhatia, PenFed Credit Union
11. 'How is the marketing department excelling, and what are its opportunities for improvement?'
CEOs and CMOs can use the answer to drill down on how automation and AI might be able to bridge the gap between “operational” and “outstanding."" For AI to be practical, leaders must approach it with a problem-first mindset. Otherwise, their AI applications will be impractical and may impede success. - Brett Hansen, Semarchy
12. 'How can we use AI to deliver better and faster?'
The AI-led marketing gains—be it insightful research, content creation, hyper-segmentation, analytics or anything else—should serve the customer better and responsibly. Delivering enhanced functionality shouldn’t come at the cost of compromising safety in the value chain. CEOs should ask their CMOs, “How can we deliver better and faster with AI to serve our customers in alignment with our core values?” - Seema Kalra, The Right Thing Marketing Communications
13. 'How can AI help us improve personalized experiences?'
Ask, ""How will integrating AI in marketing enhance our understanding of customer behavior and improve personalized experiences?"" This question is crucial because AI can revolutionize marketing by providing deeper insights into customer preferences and behaviors, enabling tailored and impactful campaigns that drive engagement and loyalty. - Antony Robinson, Novalnet AG
14. 'How can we use AI while still retaining our brand voice?'
CEOs should talk to their CMOs about using AI to make their marketing efforts more efficient while retaining their voice and brand identity. It is no surprise that a lot of AI writing sounds the same, and while AI can give you a lot of efficiency in bulk writing, marketers have to go back and edit to make sure every AI piece meets brand standards. - Sarah Lero, A.L. Huber
15. 'Does it improve our output, and at what cost?'
There's a balance between leveraging AI to save resources and still meeting company objectives. Particularly in content marketing, there's a lot of time and energy to be saved if teams can use AI effectively. However, if it doesn't improve the overall quality and output of content efforts, it's not the right use of the technology. - Maggie Mistovich, TextUs"
1bbf4c69-1ea7-4db7-ae0c-229faba0d8a6,Biological Male Reportedly Breaks Women’s Powerlifting World Record After Appearing To Mock Women For Being Weak,"A transgender powerlifter who keeps telling people he’s a chick set a Canadian “national record” for the sport Sunday, and also allegedly set an unofficial world powerlifting record.
The 40-year-old dude, who goes by the name Anne Andres and identifies as female, holds a slew of titles within the female division, competing in 11 contests over the last four years and placing first in nine of them, Reduxx reported, citing stats from Open Powerlifting. As if things couldn’t get more “South Park,” Andres claimed to be “master 1” in the sport, ignoring his obvious biological asset (he is a man).
For anyone who doesn’t understand: Men partaking in women’s sports doesn’t mean they’re winners. It means they’re taking away the winning spot from a real woman who deserves it.
Anne Andres (male who identifies and competes as a woman) doesn’t understand why female powerlifters are so “bad” at bench press….well idk Anne, but maybe it’s because you have 20 times more testosterone than them. Just a thought…. pic.twitter.com/klxd4WaoYc — Riley Gaines (@Riley_Gaines_) February 17, 2023
To make things worse, Andres appeared to mock biological women in a video shared online by former college swimmer Riley Gaines. The content is horrible to watch, and if an actual woman had posted it, she’d be cancelled on the spot.
“Why is women’s bench so bad?” Andres asked the camera. The video doesn’t really make sense, and it’s really sad to see a human who’s apparently in such a distressed position in life that they seemingly feel the need to oppress women instead of getting themselves together.
Imagine being so bad at a sport that you love, that instead of working to become the best, you just change your gender to guarantee wins? (RELATED: ‘Slap In The Face’: Daily Caller’s Kay Smythe Rips Lia Thomas’ ‘Woman Of The Year’ Nomination)
Why isn’t this type of behavior considered cheating at best, and a severe mental health issue at worst? It feels like cheating to me. Also, Andres reportedly set the “national record” in Canada, which barely even counts in Canada. An unnamed source who attended the competition also said Andres set the unofficial world record, according to Reduxx, as if anyone with an ounce of self respect would even care in this context."
818dd4f3-538d-4a61-abad-26fc94796319,Trump Opens Ohio Rally With Salute to Jan. 6 'Hostages',"In a new wrinkle to his presidential campaign rallies Saturday in Dayton, Ohio, former President Donald Trump opened with a salute to the Jan. 6 ""hostages,"" a term that has caused consternation among Democrats and their liberal media allies.
""You see the spirit from the hostages, and that's what they are: hostages,"" Trump told a rally that aired live and in its entirely on Newsmax and simulcast on the Newsmax2 online streaming platform. ""They've been treated terribly and very unfairly. And you know that and everybody knows that.""
The rally began with the Pledge of Allegiance, as repeated by the Washington, D.C., jail that has housed the Jan. 6 defendants that have yet to have been prosecuted — and uncharged in some cases.
""We're going to be working on that soon as the first day we get into office,"" Trump said. ""We're going to save our country. We're going to work with the people to treat those unbelievable patriots — and they were unbelievable patriots — and are you see[ing] the spirit? Just cheering.
""They're cheering while they're doing that, and they did that in prison. And it's a disgrace in my opinion.""

getty
Many people think that they'll never know enough to call themselves an expert in certain subject matters. However, you don’t need to know everything in order to be a valuable problem solver for your niche.
Having a PhD or being a world renowned specialist on that certain topic will help you gain that authority, but sometimes when you’re a few feet ahead of your audience and look back to guide them forward, that’s all it takes for them to see you as the expert.
In order to help you gain that confidence and authority, I’d like to share how you can position yourself as a person of influence or go-to expert in your niche.
Get Active On Social Media
In this day and age, the majority of businesses gain visibility, authority and sales from utilizing the power of social media marketing.
All of these powerful platforms provide the space to use your voice and connect to millions, if not billions, of people on a daily basis, while showcasing your knowledge and brand.
The key is to start small and create impact on one to two platforms that your target client uses most. Once you see success on those platforms, you can expand your marketing strategy to other channels.
Try to stay up to date with what’s trending, be strategic when building your following and stay consistent in showing up.
Publish A Blog & Build A Subscriber List
Blogging is just as popular as ever because it provides you the option to share without editorial guidelines or subject matter approval. This allows you the freedom to write and publish whatever you’d like.
This approach also rewards those who provide value to their audience—increasing followers organically based on advice and knowledge. At the end of the day, if you provide value, readers will come back for more.
Blogging also has another huge benefit: building email lists. Email addresses are gold and should be the focus of almost all your marketing efforts.
This means call-to-action phrases on every social media post. This way, you’re taking them off that borrowed platform and onto something you own such as your website, blog section or newsletter, in hopes of gaining their information so you can show up in their inbox.
Don’t Wait Until You “Feel” Like An Expert
Over the 20+ years of being a Strategic Advisor to hundreds of entrepreneurs and founders, I’ve learned that many people tend to downplay their expertise, which creates roadblocks to their success.
The reality is, you don’t need to have a degree or decades of experience to be branded as an expert.
To be an expert, you just have to really know what you’re talking about and know that topic, problem or solution inside and out.
Think of an “expert” in a different way—someone with in-depth knowledge on a topic that’s shared with an audience.
Most of us have some in-depth knowledge that took years to learn, whether we realize it or not, and there are people in the world who can deeply benefit from that knowledge.
Focus On The Target Audience’s Problems
Being an expert is about showing up for your audience and proving to them that you can solve their problems.
Maybe that’s with a product or service. Or perhaps it’s by taking a complex topic and making it easier to understand by turning it into fun, engaging videos.
Being an expert doesn’t mean you have to be celebrity-level with a wealth of education and patents to your name. You simply have to know your topic and, more importantly, understand how to share insights about it to the audience that needs it the most.
Host A Podcast
Anyone serious about building a personal or professional brand should consider launching a podcast.
You don’t have to be active daily, but a weekly or biweekly podcast is manageable for most.
Best of all, some platforms are free to produce a podcast.
You can also monetize your podcast for additional revenue streams, which is always a bonus.
Submit Guest Posts To Industry Publications
Guest posting is a tried-and-true personal strategy that’s just as effective now as it’s always been.
It’s best to start small at first. Use smaller blogs to build up your voice and gain the writing experience, then over time you'll build a portfolio that you can use to secure guest blogging opportunities with bigger publications.
Pitch To Traditional Media
Traditional media isn’t dead—far from it.
Local television or newspaper publications can offer opportunities to share insights. Small outlets like a local television or radio station are often in need of new and interesting topics.
Email these publications and tell them a little about yourself and your business, share the types of topics you are an expert in, and let them know that you’re available.
Use Other People’s Audiences To Build Up Your Own
Guest blogging, podcasting and even jumping on IG live with someone allows you to “borrow” other people’s audiences, level up your authority and spread your name to new ears, which you might not have been able to reach otherwise.
Forbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders. Do I qualify?"

U.S. officials have so far said there was no indication of the Islamic Republic's involvement in the most comprehensive attack to hit Israel since the Yom Kippur War fought against a coalition of Arab states nearly exactly half a century ago. Israel readily identified its archfoe's relation to the attack, and Iranian officials openly expressed their praise of the surprise land, sea and air strike, while distancing themselves from any actual involvement in the devastating operation.
""The success of this operation was the fact that it was a surprise, which makes it the biggest failure of the Israeli regime's security organizations during the life of this usurping regime,"" the Iranian Mission to the United Nations told Newsweek.
""They find it very difficult to accept that in the intelligence community, it is being narrated that they were defeated by a Palestinian group,"" the Mission added. ""They are attempting to justify their failure and attribute it to Iran's intelligence power and operational planning.""

With at least 700 Israelis killed, hundreds more wounded and a yet undisclosed number of hostages taken, Israel remains at war on several fronts in what Hamas named operation ""Al-Aqsa Flood"" after the sacred Muslim site at the contested Temple Mount in Jerusalem. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have launched operation ""Swords of Iron"" to strike at the heart of Hamas and allied organizations, such as Islamic Jihad, based in the effectively blockaded Gaza Strip, though Israel continues to battle Hamas militants within its own territory.
Gaza-based health officials put the Palestinian death toll at at least 493.
""The story is that we're still fighting,"" IDF Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hecht told a press briefing early Monday, Israeli time. ""There are between seven-eight open places around Gaza we still have warriors fighting terrorists.""
But a quick victory was not anticipated. Hecht acknowledged that ""it's taking more time than expected to get things back into a sort of defensive security posture of people coming and defending their communities.""
""We thought this morning we'd be in a better place of focusing right now on what we're doing and making sure Hamas pays a heavy price,"" Hecht said. ""Our military defends and is taking care of our lost ones and it's going to get worse, but we'll overcome it.""
Both the U.S. and Israel consider Hamas to be a terrorist organization. Iran views the group as legitimate manifestation of Palestinian resistance. While Hamas was born out of the ultraconservative Sunni Muslim Brotherhood, revolutionary Shiite Muslim Iran has increasingly backed the Palestinian group.
Citing senior members of Hamas and the powerful Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, based north of the contested border with Israel, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that Iranian security officials helped to plan the operation against Israel.
Responding to Newsweek's question about Tehran's role in the attack, Hecht stated that ""the Iranians are involved.""
But Hecht asserted that ""that's not the story right now."" He said that ""we're fighting against Hamas, we're making sure our northern border—which in a way is also an Iranian front—is also secured.""
Tensions remain high between Israel and Lebanon as well as with Syria, where Iran has supported the government against both rebels and jihadi groups in a civil war still raging after more than 12 years. Hezbollah has also expressed its support for the operation and says it's in active communication with the Palestinian militant leadership.
Hezbollah fired a volley of rockets into Israel on Sunday, and the IDF launched artillery into Lebanon.
""Existential threat, we're not there yet,"" Hecht said. ""Gaza, we're still fighting, we're going to turn it at some point. Lebanon, ramping up the force...if it expands into a sort of multidimensional arena, let's see where this goes.""
Newsweek has reached out to Hezbollah for comment.
Speaking to CNN on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said: ""We have not yet seen evidence that Iran directed or was behind this particular attack, but there is certainly a long relationship.""
The top U.S. diplomat denied that there was any connection between the $6 billion in frozen Iranian assets recently made available to Tehran by Washington as part of a prisoner exchange that marked a rare sign of diplomacy between the two countries made possible through the Arab state of Qatar.
Hamas too has made no mention of Iranian involvement. But the group has lashed out at the IDF's bombing of the Gaza Strip.
In comments shared with Newsweek by a Hamas spokesperson, political operative Izzat al-Rishiq ""slammed the destruction of Palestinian homes, which housed women and children, as well as mosques, and schools in Gaza by the Israeli occupation as war crimes.""
Rishiq also ""pointed out the U.S. supports the Israeli occupation's brutality by sending stockpiles of weapons and ammunition after the occupation forces fired tons of explosives on the heads of defenseless citizens across the Gaza Strip.""
He ""called on the international community and the free peoples of the world to condemn these gruesome massacres committed by the Zionist occupation."""
9cb3a858-5182-450c-8dd5-d185531ffd08,Second Job Interview For A Leadership Role? 3 Ways To Land The Top Job,"The second job interview for a leadership or management role is your opportunity to reiterate key ... [+] points, and highlight any areas of your experience you were unable to mention at the first stage getty
Congratulations. You've successfully passed at least two initial stages of the selection process (the resume/application sift and the first stage interview), and now that the candidates have been whittled down to a handful, you've been one of the few to make the cut and be progressed to the second, and sometimes final, stage.
Applying for any job can be a mentally draining experience, but especially is this the case when considering a leadership role. Job applications take on a new meaning, because you have double the extensive preparation to do. You have to think about highlighting your leadership skills and strengths throughout the entire process, preparing presentations, and answering more in-depth questions designed to test your abilities, cultural fit, and leadership vision.
So, while you should certainly pat yourself on the back and congratulate yourself for being considered favorably as a candidate, with higher chances of actually landing an offer, you should remember that the work is not yet done. The fact that you've received a second-stage interview invite does not indicate that you can now relax because you've done enough to secure the job.
What To Expect At The Second-Stage Interview
The second stage may be slightly more gruelling, as you will be meeting with more senior stakeholders, and depending on the job's hierarchy level, perhaps you might be introduced to board members, other directors, or even the CEO.
It's a positive indication that the initial interviewers have learned much about you in the prior stages of the application and interview process, but they are intrigued to learn more and introduce you to their leadership team to see you how impress and relate to them, before making their final decision. Therefore this is an interview that should be taken seriously, because you actually have a stronger fighting chance of winning them over.
At this stage, you may also be required to deliver a 10-15 minute presentation, or complete a short task pre-interview, all of which will weigh into their decision-making.
How To Prepare For A Second-Stage Leadership Interview
How do you prepare effectively for a second stage interview? This can be tricky for most people because it can be difficult to know what new questions or scenarios to expect, especially when you've already extensively prepared for and answered all the relevant interview questions you could think of, in the last interview. This presents a key opportunity for you to do three things to further cement your image in their minds:

1. Research The Organization More
If it can be safely assumed that you performed any amount of research about the company prior to the first stage interview, then now is a great time to refresh your understanding and conduct even more in-depth research. Thanks to AI tools such as Perplexity AI, you can ask it questions about any organization and receive the latest insights it has scooped from the internet. You should take the opportunity to look at the company's financial standing through analyzing financial statements, looking at any records of market performance, its current market share, and reading any detailed reports and three-year strategies.
You should also make your research more holistic, taking into consideration any current industry trends and potential risks and challenges your prospective employer might be facing, for which you can add value as a leader. This proves to them that you are forward-thinking and demonstrates true leadership qualities.
2. Review The Job Description
Sometimes, you may find that you have forgotten some of the core, or even the finer details, of the job description and person specification. Now is a good time to review them and refresh your memory, so that you can anticipate potential questions that may explore other angles not previously covered. Remember to consistently highlight leadership competencies using practical examples with the STAR method, and emphasize the results using quantifiable metrics.

3. Prepare Thoughtful Questions
It's essential to have questions on hand that you're ready to ask the interviewing panel. The worst response you can give when they ask, ""Do you have any questions for us?,"" is ""no."" Even if you've already asked them questions at the first interview, you can never ask too much. Get creative and think of some insightful questions that will position you as a strategic leader who genuinely cares about the organization you're poised to work in.
For example, you might ask, ""How does the leadership team communicate to ensure they are on the same page and working collaboratively?"" or ""What challenges do you anticipate this department will face over the course of the year?""
Prepare and ask insightful questions to dig further into their company culture, values, and vision, ... [+] to ensure it is aligned with yours getty
If you follow these three strategies—researching the company, reviewing the job spec, and preparing insightful questions—you will be sure to leave a lasting impression on the interviewing panel, and increase your chances of receiving the call with the news you've been waiting to hear:

Last week, Philly police issued the warrant for Boyle's arrest after he allegedly violated a protection from abuse order. But on Monday, Krasner said officials learned that there is no active protection from abuse order Boyle could've violated.
""This does not mean, one way or another, that Mr. Boyle committed no crime,"" Krasner said. ""That is a matter to be determined later, but based on the information we have today, which is more complete than the apparently accurate information we had before, we do not find that there is probable cause to justify a warrant for the arrest of Mr. Boyle for violating a protection from abuse order on the dates in question.""
Boyle was arrested and charged in 2021 for harassment and violating a protection order filed by his estranged wife. At the time, his attorney called it a domestic issue.
Boyle, a Democrat, represents Pennsylvania District 172, which covers parts of Montgomery County and Northeast Philadelphia. He has represented the district since 2011 and is currently seeking his eighth term.
Kevin Boyle's brother, Brendan, a Congressmember who represents Pennsylvania's Second District, said his brother's struggle with mental illness has been a nightmare for their family.

Although fears of a U.S. recession loomed over much of 2023, a resilient economy surprised forecasters by gaining speed on the strength of robust consumer spending and solid job gains.
So what can we expect for 2024? Here's what one financial pundit had to say.
""The funny thing about 2024 is that there's nothing entirely new under the sun,"" said Javier David, managing editor, business and markets, at Axios and a CBS News contributor. ""Most of the themes include a continuation of what was the last year. They're all interconnected — inflation, Fed policy and response, jobs market, recession fears.""
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in December hinted at interest rate cuts in 2024 as inflation cools. That spark of hope has led some economists to speculate on not if, but when those rate cuts may begin. Despite a strong December jobs report, a potential inflation risk if the economy continues to run hot, many experts remain optimistic that the central bank will lower rates this year.
Still, David cautioned that there may be many bumps ahead for the economy on the road to possible interest rate cuts.
""So the thing here that everybody needs to keep in mind is inflation has been tamed, the preferred gauge the Fed watches is floating around the Fed's target of 2%, but the risks are still there, and that's particularly because consumers have continued to open up their wallets and add to their credit card debt,"" he said.
Consumer spending rose at a 3.6% annual rate from July through September in 2023, and shoppers continued to open their wallets for the holidays despite the fact that many Americans say they're spending more than they earn. That aligns with 2023 data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that shows consumers owe a record $986 billion in credit card debt, up 17% from 2022.
""The paradox is everyone expects the Fed to cut, but they're only going to do so unless conditions turn recessionary. Currently, they are not,"" said David, who emphasized the correlation between robust consumer spending and the economy's strength.
""We should all thank our lucky stars that the American people continue to spend, because our economy is two-thirds consumer spending ... that's what's driving this train, that's what's keeping the jobs market afloat, that's what's keeping companies from mass layoffs.""
Even if consumers rein in spending and the economy slips into a recession, he said, there's a good chance it will be mild.
""We're entering 2024 much like we entered 2023. Everyone was fearful of a recession. People think a recession will happen, but all recessions aren't created equal. We could see a downturn. We don't have to see a repeat of 2020 or 2008, which were pretty extreme Black Swan events that really created tough economic conditions. So we could see a softening without a collapse in economic activity.""
What's the biggest X factor for the economy in 2024? That would be the outcome of November's national election, according to David.
""I'm not in the predictions game, but I do think things are going to get dicey closer to the elections. And the election is arguably the biggest wild card and the only real unknown hanging over the 2024 economy. So I do think we'll see a Fed cut in the second half, but not before then."""
d5e42ef6-7571-43cd-8e74-2acb94027845,A High-profile Murder Trial in Kazakhstan Boosts Awareness of Domestic Violence,"The CCTV footage shown at the domestic abuse trial was disturbing: The defendant is seen dragging his wife by her hair, and then punching and kicking her. Hours after it was recorded, she died of brain trauma.
The trial of businessman Kuandyk Bishimbayev, Kazakhstan's former economy minister, in the death of his wife, Saltanat Nukenova, has touched a nerve in the Central Asian country. Tens of thousands of people have signed petitions calling for harsher penalties for domestic violence.
On April 11, senators approved a bill toughening spousal abuse laws, and President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev signed it four days later. It's been dubbed “Saltanat's Law” in her honor.
Kazakhs are riveted by Bishimbayev’s trial, the first in the country of over 19 million people to be streamed online, and debates about it are dominating social media. Many see it as a moment of truth for Tokayev's promises of reforms and making officials accountable.
The 44-year-old Bishimbayev, once seen as a fresh, Western-educated face of Kazakhstan’s government under former leader Nursultan Nazarbayev, was jailed for bribery in 2018 before being pardoned less than two years into his 10-year sentence.
Nukenova, 31, was found dead in November in a restaurant owned by one of her husband's relatives. Bishimbayev, who was charged with torturing and killing her, for weeks maintained his innocence but admitted Wednesday in court that he had beaten her and “unintentionally” caused her death.
His lawyers initially disputed medical evidence indicating Nukenova died from repeated blows to the head. They also portrayed her as prone to jealousy and violence, although no video from the restaurant's security cameras that was played in court has shown her attacking Bishimbayev.
Aitbek Amangeldy, Nukenova’s elder brother and a key prosecution witness, told The Associated Press that he had no doubt his sister’s tragic fate has shifted attitudes about domestic violence.
“It changes people’s minds when they see directly what it looks like when a person is tortured,” Amangeldy said in a video interview, citing the harrowing video played in court.
“Of course, it’s difficult for me to be in court, to listen to various things that the defendant’s side has been saying,"" he said. ""It’s even more painful to know that (their) words are being broadcast across the country. But I understand that these broadcasts are also educational material, including for lawyers and human rights defenders.”
Like neighboring Russia, Kazakhstan largely remains a patriarchal society, and progress has been slow on issues such as domestic violence, sexual harassment, and disparities in employment.
According to a 2018 study backed by UN Women, the United Nations’ gender equality agency, about 400 women die from domestic violence each year in Kazakhstan, although many abuse cases go unreported.
In 2017, Kazakhstan decriminalized beatings and other acts causing “minor” physical damage, making them punishable only by fines or short jail terms. Russia enacted a similar law that year, outraging women’s rights advocates. Kazakhstan's new law reverses this, increasing penalties for assailants and introducing new criminal offenses, including harassment of minors.
Days after Nukenova's death, her relatives launched an online petition urging authorities to pass “Saltanat's Law” to bolster protection for those at risk of domestic violence. It quickly got over 150,000 signatures.
As Bishimbayev’s trial began, more than 5,000 Kazakhs wrote senators urging tougher laws on abuse, Kazakh media said.
Still, Amangeldy said the law's final version failed to include all the provisions his family and allies had wanted, noting that “we still have no legal norms around stalking and harassment"" of adults.
Viktoriya Kim, a Kazakhstan-based researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the very notion of ""domestic violence” is absent from the country's criminal code. Including it, she said, would send “a clearer signal.”
But Amangeldy argues that Kazakh society has clearly “passed a point of no return.”
“For years, across Kazakhstan and the whole region, the issue (of domestic violence) was shrouded in silence. Raising the issue is already half the solution,” he said.
Women's rights advocate Aigerim Kussainkyzy said Bishimbayev’s trial has led to “a collective awakening” among politicians and ordinary citizens.
“Some may even label it the trial of the century. ... Male politicians, in particular, have started to consider the implications of domestic violence for their own daughters,” said Kussainkyzy, who was among civil society representatives that lawmakers consulted before passing the bill.
The proposals encountered fierce pushback from the Kazakh Union of Parents — an influential association that echoes Russia’s opposition to feminist initiatives and LGBTQ+ rights.
Tokayev has talked repeatedly about strengthening protections for women. In January, he intervened after the Justice Ministry refused to consider the petition by Nukenova’s family.
Despite the inclusion of activists in the legislative process, some Kazakh rights defenders argue the law's passage has been accompanied by continuing pressure on those advocates, independent of the government.
Last month, authorities in Almaty — Kazakhstan's largest city and business hub — blocked a rally for International Women's Day to show solidarity with victims of domestic abuse. Feminita, the feminist and LGBTQ+ rights group that tried to organize it, has struggled for years for official registration.
In December, Kazakhstan put women’s rights activist Dina Smailova on its wanted list after authorities launched a criminal fraud investigation that she described as likely retribution for her work.
Smailova, head of the NeMolchi.KZ foundation, which means “Don't Be Silent” and advocates for abuse survivors, told AP that she and her organization were unable to join discussions on the new law.
“I’ve lost faith in the authorities, because even as they pass a law protecting women and children from violence, they pass harsher laws against independent journalists and bloggers,” Smailova said in an interview from Montenegro, where she lives.
She welcomed the bill “as a first step,” but said it can only be adequately implemented after tackling “corruption and nepotism” within law enforcement and the courts, citing the fraud case against her.
“Kazakhstan is a country where everyone has a lot of relatives … and if there’s a case concerning a relative of someone in law enforcement, then that person will certainly evade responsibility,” she said, adding that education and media campaigns are needed to change attitudes.
Senate Speaker Maulen Ashimbayev said that properly implementing the law will require “a great deal of work,” including educational campaigns in schools and the media, as well as vigilance from civil society groups.
HRW's Kim told AP the investigation of Smailova, who has repeatedly criticized officials’ failure to protect abused women and children, was marred by “numerous procedural infractions,” raising “serious concerns that she is being persecuted.”
“I would like to see more willingness from authorities to help and support those who fight for and promote women’s rights,” the researcher said, noting concerns about Kazakhstan's global reputation played a role in its willingness to act on domestic violence.
“International organizations have called for this particular step for years. That’s something the authorities were ready to do to meet rights defenders halfway,” she said.
Meanwhile, Bishimbayev’s trial continues to spark controversy. Police are investigating telephone threats reported by Judge Ayzhan Kulbayeva after she disallowed forensic evidence from defense lawyers alleging Nukenova’s death could have been caused by a preexisting condition.
As closing arguments approach, debate rages in Kazakhstan over its justice system and women's rights, with many believing the trial already has changed the country forever.

The fatal landslide occurred in Liangshui village, destroying dozens of homes.
The initial collapse was triggered by the collapse of a steep cliff area, officials say.
The bodies of the remaining victims of a landslide in southwestern China were recovered Thursday, bringing the death toll to 44 after four days of searching through the rubble of dirt and crumbled homes, state media said.
The final body was found in the evening, according to state broadcaster CCTV, which posted photos of excavators and teams of searchers in orange uniforms and helmets, part of a contingent of more than 1,000 rescuers.
The landslide slammed into houses at the foot of a slope early Monday morning in Liangshui, a village in a remote and mountainous part of Yunnan province. It left a barren swath on the slope after hitting the village, which sits between snow-covered, terraced fields.
LANDSLIDE IN CHINA BURIES 47 PEOPLE IN MORE THAN A DOZEN HOMES
Two survivors were found on Monday.
A preliminary investigation found that the landslide had been triggered by the collapse of a steep clifftop area, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. It did not elaborate on the cause of the initial collapse.
Rescuers struggled with snow, icy roads and freezing temperatures. The area is about 1,400 miles southwest of Beijing, the Chinese capital, with altitudes ranging up to 7,900 feet.

A strong earthquake also struck western China this week, killing three people in the Xinjiang region in the northwest. The death toll from Tuesday's magnitude 7.1 quake was low because it was a relatively deep one, far below the surface, in a sparsely populated area, experts said. Local officials also credited efforts to improve housing in the area.
In another tragedy, a fire in a commercial building in southeastern China’s Jiangxi province killed at least 39 people on Wednesday."

Partial transcript as follows:
RACHEL SCOTT: Leader Schumer was very blunt in his remarks on the Senate floor, he called Netanyahu an obstacle to peace. He’s calling for new elections in Israel. The President called that a good speech. What did he mean by that? Does the administration believe that there needs to be new elections in Israel?
HARRIS: Well, I will not speak for Senator Schumer. But we are very clear that that is on the Israeli people to make a decision about when they will have an election and who of course they elect to lead their government. That’s for them to say.
SCOTT: Do you believe that Netanyahu is an obstacle to peace?
HARRIS: I believe that we have got to continue to enforce what we know to be and should be the priorities in terms of what is happening in Gaza. We’ve been very clear that far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. We have been very clear that Israel and the Israeli people and Palestinians are entitled to an equal amount of security and, and dignity. And frankly, we have been very focused on also getting the hostages out and getting aid in.
SCOTT: Netanyahu appears to just be flat out ignoring President Biden’s warning about an offensive in Rafah. Is that a red line for your administration?
HARRIS: We have been clear in multiple conversations and in every way that any major military operation in Rafah would be a huge mistake. Let me tell you something, I have studied the maps–there’s nowhere for those folks to go. And we’re looking at about a million and a half people in Rafah who are there because they were told to go there, most of them. And so we’ve been very clear that it would be a mistake to move into Rafah with any type of military operation.
SCOTT: A mistake, but would there be consequences if he does move forward?
HARRIS: Well, we’re gonna take it one step at a time, but we’ve been very clear in terms of our perspective on whether or not that should happen.
SCOTT: Are you ruling out that there would be consequences from the United States?
HARRIS: I am ruling out nothing."

In a Wednesday filing with U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon, his lawyers said that the “SCIF” — a sensitive compartmented information facility — that had been set up for Trump on his South Florida property during his presidency be reestablished, and that it was simply too burdensome for Trump to have to travel to already existing SCIFs in the area to consult with his lawyers as they prepare for trial.

“Both the required security protocol surrounding President Trump’s travel and the challenges surrounding the media’s and public’s intense focus on this prosecution pose an enormous obstacle to our ability to provide counsel to President Trump regarding classified matters, which are, no doubt, essential to the case,” Chris Kise and Todd Blanche wrote in the 11-page brief.
“Limiting any discussions with counsel to the government offered SCIFs is an inappropriate, unnecessary, and unworkable restriction,” they wrote. “Re-establishing the same secure area that existed during President Trump’s term as President of the United States is a secure, efficient, and cost-effective way for these conversations to take place in a fully secure environment.”

The request is yet another instance of Trump asking for privileges not granted to ordinary criminal defendants. He has so far been charged on 78 felony counts in three indictments but has yet to wear handcuffs, post bail, surrender his passport or even have his mug shot taken.

In the Mar-a-Lago case, Trump was indicted in June for retaining classified documents in his ballroom, his office, even his bathroom, and then trying to hide them from authorities seeking their return. An updated indictment filed late last month added charges that he tried to erase a computer server containing incriminating videotaped footage of his employees moving the documents from one place to another at his request.
Trump’s lawyers on Wednesday denied that allegation. “No videotapes were deleted or destroyed,” they wrote. “Indeed, President Trump has produced to the special counsel’s office what amounts to more than eight years of CCTV footage.”
A trial in the Mar-a-Lago case has been tentatively set for May, although that was before the new charges were added.
Trump is also facing a second federal indictment filed last week for his actions leading up to and on his Jan. 6, 2021, coup attempt. No trial date has been set in that case, while a March trial is set in a New York City case in which he is accused of falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 hush money payment to a porn star in the days leading up to the 2016 election.
A fourth indictment could come as early as next week in Georgia, where the Fulton County district attorney has been investigating his attempts to coerce state elections officials into overturning his loss in that state to Democrat Joe Biden.

It is the Timex economy. Like the wristwatches in those old commercials, it takes a licking and keeps on ticking.
Why it matters: There is a tendency to seize on each piece of worrying news as marking the end of the pandemic recovery. And of course, this expansion will one day end. But it's worth accounting for the almost stubborn resilience of this economy in the face of problems.
Catch up quick: The S&P 500 peaked Jan. 3, 2022, the first business day of last year. Consider some of the things that have happened since then.
The Fed has raised interest rates from near-zero to above 5%, and has shifted from pumping $60 billion a month into the financial system through quantitative easing to sucking up to $95 billion a month out of the system.
Mortgage rates have more than doubled, causing a deep freeze in home sales activity last year that's now starting to thaw.
Valuations of tech companies plunged, especially those with tenuous finances. Even some of the most successful companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google announced large-scale layoffs.
Three banks with more than $500 billion in combined assets failed, and the government invoked emergency authorities to protect their depositors.
There were widespread fears that a debt ceiling standoff could end in a catastrophic default on U.S. Treasury securities — fears that dissipated after the Biden administration and House Republicans struck a deal.
Despite it all, the unemployment rate, even after ticking up to 3.7% in May, was lower than it ever was during the booming expansions of the 1980s, 1990s or mid-2000s.
The S&P 500, after falling 25% between January and its October low, has surged about 20%. It's now only 10% below the high.
Between the lines: The financial markets are not the economy. The handful of industries that are the subjects of intense media focus are not the economy. Fed policy is not the economy.
The economy is the combined efforts of 161 million workers producing $26 trillion worth of goods and services a year across countless industries, fulfilling demand from 332 million Americans and billions of people around the globe.
The bottom line: The U.S. economy is a powerful machine with a momentum of its own. It may yet falter more meaningfully than it already has as the Fed keeps trying to bring inflation down."

getty
In the dynamic landscape of organizational change, I see the concept of polarity emerging as a powerful tool for senior leadership teams (SLTs) who grapple with the intricate challenges posed by modern business environments.
Polarities, characterized by inherent tensions between interdependent pairs, permeate every facet of organizational life—from strategic decision-making to day-to-day operations. I believe that recognizing and learning to manage these polarities can significantly impact your organization’s ability to thrive in a fast-paced world.
Understanding Polarities In Organizational Context
Polarities are not problems to be solved but realities to be managed. They are sets of opposites that cannot function well independently. For instance, consider the strategic polarity of ""innovation versus stability."" Organizations must innovate to remain competitive, yet they also need stability to ensure consistent delivery and reliability. Overemphasizing innovation can lead to chaos, while too much focus on stability might result in stagnation. Neither is inherently good or bad; they are both necessary for long-term success.
Similarly, leadership teams often face the polarity of ""autonomy versus collaboration."" Leaders want to empower their employees, giving them autonomy to make decisions and act independently. However, they also recognize the value of collaboration, where collective decision-making and shared responsibilities lead to more cohesive and robust solutions. Striking the right balance between these poles is crucial for fostering an environment that encourages creativity and teamwork while maintaining individual accountability and initiative.
Identifying Organizational Strategy Polarities
Strategic polarities extend beyond daily operations, touching the core of organizational direction and purpose. For example, ""short-term gains versus long-term sustainability."" SLTs are under pressure to deliver immediate results to satisfy stakeholders, which may conflict with the need to invest in long-term sustainability and growth initiatives. Balancing these concerns requires a nuanced understanding of the organization's strategic objectives and the external environment.
Another strategic polarity is ""customer focus versus internal efficiency."" While customer-centric approaches drive business success by tailoring products and services to meet consumer needs, internal efficiency focuses on optimizing operations and reducing costs. Though seemingly at odds, both are essential for organizational health and competitiveness.
Senior Leadership Team Polarities
Senior leadership is about recognizing organizational polarities and consciously navigating them hence the SLT is not immune. It involves understanding when to focus on global strategies without neglecting local markets or when to emphasize long-term growth without sacrificing short-term results.
For SLTs, strategic thinking must be balanced with operational focus. As yet another example, ""decision-making speed versus accuracy"" is a common tension I see, where the need for swift action can conflict with the desire for thorough analysis. Similarly, ""strategic focus versus operational focus"" challenges leaders to balance their time and attention between setting the organization's direction and ensuring effective execution. Other polarities I’ve encountered include:
1. Optimism versus critical thinking. Maintaining an optimistic outlook can be motivational, but it needs to be tempered with critical thinking to anticipate potential challenges and devise solid strategies.
2. Consistency versus adaptability. Leaders must be consistent in their principles and policies to build trust, but they also need to be adaptable to pivot when circumstances change or new information comes to light.
3. Responsiveness versus proactivity. You have to balance your response to your board’s input directives while proactively addressing your organization's immediate needs.
4. Alignment versus advocacy. This involves ensuring that the SLT’s work aligns with organizational goals while also advocating for their team's interests and resources.
5. Personal growth versus organizational needs. While leaders should pursue personal growth and development, I believe that their primary focus should always align with the goals of the organization.
Strategies For Managing Organizational Polarities
A key strategy for SLTs in managing polarities is to actively and openly discuss the polarities they manage and to train their teams to recognize and balance these as well.
This can help create a culture that values adaptability and understands the need for ""both/and"" thinking rather than ""either/or"" decision-making. Open conversations about the interplay between poles like innovation and tradition can lead to breakthroughs in how these concepts are operationalized.
Additionally, instituting regular check-ins where teams can reflect on the balance of polarities encourages ongoing adjustment and alignment with organizational values and goals.
To effectively manage these polarities, senior leadership teams can adopt several strategies.
1. Adopt a ""both/and"" mindset. Shift from seeing polarities as either/or choices to both/and opportunities. This mindset encourages leaders to seek integrative solutions that harness the strengths of both poles.
2. Implement polarity thinking in decision-making. Incorporate polarity management into strategic planning and decision-making processes. This ensures that polarities are considered and balanced in key decisions.
3. Map polarities. Begin by identifying and mapping out the key polarities within your organization. Understand the values on either side of the polarity and how they contribute to your organizational goals.
4. Leverage polarity metrics. Develop metrics to measure the health of both poles within a polarity. For example, innovation initiatives could be balanced with metrics for operational stability, ensuring neither is neglected.
5. Create polarity awareness. Educate your team about the nature of polarities and the importance of balancing them. Awareness is the first step toward effective management.
6. Encouraging dialogue and debate. Foster an environment where different perspectives are valued and explored. Dialogue helps uncover the benefits of each pole and can lead to innovative solutions that bridge the gap between them.
Conclusion
Polarity thinking can offer a powerful framework for understanding and leveraging the inherent tensions within organizational strategy and leadership.
By identifying, mapping and actively managing these polarities, senior leadership teams can enhance their strategic agility, foster a more adaptive organizational culture and achieve a harmonious balance between competing demands. The goal is not to choose one pole over the other but to recognize and embrace the interdependent nature of these forces, using them to drive the organization forward in a more nuanced and effective manner.

fc22116b-946c-49b2-af76-06a395bddeb8,Home sales in June fell to the slowest pace since January with near-historic low inventory for sale,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell in June to the slowest pace since January, as a near-historic low number of homes for sale and rising mortgage rates kept many would-be homebuyers on the sidelines. The national median sales price fell on an annual basis for the fifth month in a row, though fierce competition led to about one-third of homes selling for more than their list price.
Existing home sales fell 3.3% last month from May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.16 million, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. That’s slightly below what economists were expecting, according to FactSet, and marks the slowest sales pace since January.
Sales sank 18.9% compared with June last year. All told, sales are down 23% through the first half of this year.
The national median sales price fell 0.9% from June last year to $410,200. That’s the smallest annual decline since March. While down from a year earlier, the median sales price rose from the previous month, reaching the second-highest level on records going back to January 1999.
“Perhaps home prices are beginning to firm up or at least certainly any downward pressure is ending,” said Lawrence Yun, the NAR’s chief economist.
The latest housing market figures are more evidence that even with prices easing back on an annual basis after rising for more than a decade many house hunters are being held back by a persistently low inventory of homes for sale.
Some 1.08 million homes remained on the market by the end of June, down 13.6% from a year earlier, the NAR said. That amounts to a 3.1-month supply at the current sales pace. In a more balanced market between buyers and sellers, there is a 5- to 6-month supply.
The shortage of homes for sale has kept the market competitive, driving bidding wars in many places, especially for the most affordable homes. About one-third of homes purchased last month sold for above their list price, and 76% of homes sold in June were on the market for less than a month.
“This is a tough market to be a buyer,” Yun said.
The combination of high borrowing costs and intense competition for the most affordable homes on the market is shutting out many first-time buyers. They accounted for 27% of home sales last month, down from 28% in May and 30% in June last year, the NAR said. In a normal housing market, that would be 40%.
The U.S. housing market has yet to emerge from a slump that started a little more than a year ago, when the average rate on a 30-year mortgage began to climb from ultra-low levels as the Federal Reserve began raising its short-term rate in its fight against inflation.
Global demand for U.S. Treasurys, which lenders use as a guide to pricing loans, investors’ expectations for future inflation and what the Fed does with interest rates influence rates on home loans.
The average rate on a 30-year home loan is still more than double what it was two years ago, when the ultra-low rates spurred a wave of home sales and refinancing. Weekly average rates on a 30-year mortgage ranged between 6.67% and 6.79% in June, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. This week, the average rate slipped to 6.78%, the lowest level in four weeks. A year ago, the rate averaged 5.54%.
Higher mortgage rates can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for homebuyers on top of already high home prices. They also discourage homeowners who locked in those low rates two years ago from selling -- one reason the supply of homes for sale has been low even during the traditionally busy spring homebuying season."
fcabfae3-87be-4bac-9b97-c383b6fe4da7,Algo-Ethics As A Hope For Evolution,"We live in a society that the Accademia della Crusca, in its online periodical, has defined as an “algocracy”: a form of information society based on algorithms. Or, as defined by the Cambridge Dictionary: “a social system in which people are governed and important decisions are made by algorithms”. That is mathematical methods or procedures that are applied to problem solving. Algorithms are, by now, behind many of our actions and choices, but they are, above all, the basis of anything going by the name of Artificial Intelligence, whether they be ChatGpt, systems of automatic driving or health diagnostics. Or even the hypothesis of instruments that can automatically administer justice without the bias of human intervention.
This issue is now being hotly debated. Only a few days ago, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, one of the founders of the company that created the Artificial Intelligence software ChatGPT, took part in a hearing in the U.S. Senate to discuss the risks and the opportunities involved in this technology. Altman shared the fears of some Senators and expressed the hope that the matter would soon be regulated by suitable legislation. In particular, he defined “a reasonable cause for worry” the possible use of AI software to interfere in normal electoral processes. Altman said: “If this technology is used in the wrong way, it can become very “wrong”. We want to work with the government on this to avoid it happening”.
The World Health Organization has also just issued a statement inviting caution in the use of AI systems that employ health data to formulate diagnoses or even therapies.
A warning has also come from Pope Francis, who, already back in 2021 appealed to the giants of technology to “stop exploiting human fragility and people’s vulnerability in the name of profit”. The Vatican has, among other things, just sponsored a project called “Rome Call. What is the matter with AI ethics?”, which has united exponents of the three Abrahamic religions (Hebrews, Christians and Muslims) together with leaders from the world of technology, such as Microsoft and IBM, to promote ethical reflection on the subject which has become known as “Algo-ethics”.
Why do we need “Algo-ethics”? Because, for the first time since the Industrial Revolution, we are faced with an unknown and explosive perspective. If, up until now, technological evolution has led to creating machines to do something that can be predicted by human intelligence, now AI is creating thinking machines, capable of automatically replying to a problem posed. But how exactly will they do it?
How can we be sure that the choice of the machine is made on the basis of correct data, interpreted in the very best possible way? A frequently used example can serve to sum up the question: how will automatically driven cars react when they have to decide whether to prefer the driver’s safety, even if a passer-by may be harmed in the process?
Algo-ethics: the vast and mostly unexplored new potentials that are starting to appear with the use ... [+] of AI make it urgent to apply proper ethics to these powerful algorithms Anna Zanardi
The algorithms that guide AI base their decisions on the analysis of a series of data with which they are provided. But such data could be manipulated, or provide only a partial view of reality. Not that this doesn’t occur with humans, too: many are the decisions, whether financial or concerning health, that are sometimes taken on the basis of superficial knowledge. Or worse, on the basis of data that are clearly false. Human beings, however, have the chance to correct this automatism, by referring to shared values and behavior which go by the name of ethics.
To sum up, there is the possibility that AI may make mistakes or fail to take into account any existing unpredictable variables. And it is into this room to maneuver that algo-ethics must be introduced, with instruments that can change decisions made by AI in the presence of values held by human beings to be superior.
Certainly, one field that requires such algo-ethical reflection is that of health: AI will increasingly be involved in helping to better patients’ health care. Access to data banks with millions of cases will make it possible to compare clinical situations and, eventually, therapies and treatments used with positive results in a few cases to be divined. But, at the same time, AI could, on the basis of the same data, give a poor prognosis and recommend suspension of treatment. Without bearing in mind the imponderable or that, in medicine, the imponderable may, indeed, occur.
What is important to bear in mind is that Artificial Intelligence is not infallible and that errors are part and parcel of its functioning. But how can these errors be handled? How can such mechanics, that actually cancel the irrationality of hope from the horizon of thought, be avoided? In other words: how is it possible to introduce discretion and the ability to discern, typical of human intelligence, to the system of data management, in such a way, for example, as to protect the weaker and more fragile, but also to avoid easy manipulations based on fake news? Only a couple of days ago, a photograph created by AI, apparently showing an explosion at the Pentagon, was circulating on the Net and managed to create a Wall Street crisis before it was proved to be false.
Maybe the solution can be found in using doubt: the doubt that humans must continue to foster when faced with machine made decisions. But even more important is that Man must intervene in automatic decisional mechanisms. If something seems wrong, if the data are controversial, then by introducing a mechanism of “doubt” and inducing the machine to request human confirmation may be the way to avoid the most dangerous deviations of Artificial Intelligence while, at the same time, exploiting all of its indubitable possibilities. Doubt is quite rare among the options of our contemporaries; we are full of certainties, only to go on to make colossal blunders. Then algo-ethics become really essential, letting mankind start over from one of the simplest and noblest of truths: I know that I don’t know."

Tong Sun, a 45-year-old illegal alien from China, was arrested and charged after federal prosecutors said he crossed illegally into the U.S. via the southern border and was found with child pornography on his phone by Border Patrol agents.
This week, a federal grand jury issued a one-count indictment against Sun and he is expected to make his initial appearance before a federal judge sometime in the near future.
Sun first crossed the border at the beginning of May just as President Joe Biden’s administration lifted Title 42, one of the few remaining border controls that remained until May 11.
Just a few days before officially lifting Title 42, Border Patrol agents searched Sun’s phone and allege that it contained videos of children in pornographic depictions. In one particular three-minute video, a girl as young as five years old was the subject.
Sun now faces up to 20 years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000.

Just before midnight Friday, police were called out to the 1700 block of Magnolia Dr. after a drive-by shooting in which one person was hit by shrapnel, according to a statement Saturday from the Yuba City Police Department.
At the scene, police spotted the suspect vehicle driving westbound on Bogue Rd. The officers followed the vehicle, which went through surface streets. The suspect vehicle ultimately crashed near Harding Rd. and Cherry St. Three people ran from the vehicle, with officers close behind.
Yuba City K9 ""Rip"" caught one of the suspects and a second suspect surrendered without incident, police say. Authorities set up a perimeter and searched the area using the K9 and a Sutter County Sheriff's Office drone.
The third suspect was never found.
The driver of the vehicle, 19-year-old Israel Morales, was booked into the Sutter County Jail for attempted murder, shooting at an inhabited dwelling, and felony evading. The second suspect was a 16-year-old juvenile, who was booked into Tri-Counties Juvenile Hall on charges of attempted murder and shooting at an inhabited dwelling"
d78614a0-282b-43c8-8ffc-2281d155891d,"Tupac was killed 27 years ago. To Gen Z, his spirit is very much alive.","At around 15, Allegria Di’lecarta found her style icon. Her teenage friends did not quite understand her new obsession. The icon — plastered on posters all over her room, his face emblazoned on her T-shirts — had famously been dead for decades.
But Di’lecarta didn’t care. She took a deep dive into his music and declared that Tupac Shakur was it for her.
Now 20 and living in East London, Di’lecarta keeps visual reminders of the artist, who will be forever 25; in a TikTok video celebrating her adoration for the rapper, she flaunts a phone case with an image of Tupac hugging his longtime friend Jada Pinkett Smith, and a backpack sporting a collage of Tupac faces.
Di’lecarta said she often wears her Tupac backpack “so people know what I’m on.”

In 2023, Shakur’s face and name lives on in the public consciousness, especially as Gen Z replicates the ‘90s aesthetic. The rapper and actor, who was killed in 1996, was posthumously honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The city of Oakland, California, renamed a stretch of MacArthur Boulevard to Tupac Shakur Way to honor its famed resident.
But most notably, in September Las Vegas prosecutors arrested and charged Duane “Keffe D” Davis in connection with Shakur’s murder, finally yielding some answers in a decades-old homicide. As Davis’ case unfolds, Tupac’s influence and relevance in Black culture has remained as influential as it was at the peak of his career. This, experts and fans say, stems from his lyrics’ seeming timelessness, with his words about racism, police brutality, poverty and Black pride resonating with new generations.
The way Shakur remarked on these and other social ills was “particularly poignant and remarkable,” said Barbod Salimi, a scholar who taught a class called “The Prophetic Witness of Tupac Shakur” at Boston University.
His significance all these decades after his death, however, was no accident according to Shakur himself.

In 1995, the rapper appeared on a now-famous cover of Vibe magazine, in which he spoke to journalist Kevin Powell from Rikers Island in New York City, as he awaited sentencing for sexual assault charges from an incident in 1993, an allegation he denied.
At the time, a little over a year before he was shot to death in Las Vegas, Shakur said he wanted to do the interview because it was only a matter of time before he was killed. And his legacy was on his mind. He had just survived being shot five times a few months prior.
“God let me live for me to do something extremely extraordinary, and that’s what I have to do,” Tupac said to Powell.
The rapper also said he felt “close” to Marvin Gaye, who was 44 when he was killed, and Vincent van Gogh due to how tormented they were, and because nobody appreciated van Gogh’s work until he was dead. “Now it’s worth millions,” he said.
Powell wrote three cover stories about Tupac for Vibe in the 1990s.
“Pac is not going anywhere,” said Powell, now a Grammy-nominated poet and author of 16 books, including an upcoming biography on Tupac. He likened the rapper’s legacy to that of President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated 60 years ago in November. They were both larger than life, “bigger than the generation of the times that they lived in — and they speak to us in different ways beyond whenever they were alive.”
Social media has played an important part in spreading Shakur’s music and message and expanding his legacy. On TikTok alone, #2pac has 9.3 billion views. His official YouTube channel has more than 3 billion views and 7.36 million subscribers. Tupac’s style and boldness, Di’lecarta said, has had a significant effect on young people.
“Being a Black British person and a part of Gen Z, like, my interest in him was almost weird,” said Di’lecarta, who is an aspiring actor. “I was genuinely seen as kind of a bit weird because I love this guy so much.”

While some fans discovered Tupac on their own, others like Joseph Phillips discovered his songs through family who “used to play his music a lot.” Phillips is 24 and lives in Memphis, Tennessee. He said he was initially too young to fully grasp the meaning of Shakur’s lyrics, but started listening on his own. He became “a super Tupac fan” in the sixth grade, he said.
Two years later, Phillips’ mother gave him Shakur’s 1995 CD “Me Against the World.” He remembers playing it and replaying it endlessly.
His immersion into all things Pac, including past interviews and his original tracks, inspired him to write. He needed an outlet to express himself. “So, I chose poems,” he said.
Salimi, who taught the class at Boston University, said he used Tupac’s music as source materials for students, who would perform socio-cultural analyses pertaining to race, identity, culture and politics. He calls Shakur a “truth teller.”
Powell said he was one of the very first people to listen to “Dear Mama.” He remembers listening to the track in his office at Vibe, where he “literally sat there and cried.”
“That song — for a Black mother, for Black women — I think is one of the most powerful songs we’ve ever created in American music history. Not just Black music, but music period,” Powell said.
Yet, Tupac’s stardom didn’t come without scrutiny. Some criticized the rapper for his gangster persona, along with lyrics that encouraged violence. Shakur pushed back on those negative views in a 1995 interview with the Los Angeles Times, shortly after his release from prison: “I am not a gangster and never have been,” he said.
Like other artists, Shakur was a human being “just trying to figure it out,” Powell said. The rapper also didn’t get to experience the entirety of his life, including a “whole evolution,” due to his premature death, Powell added.
Tupac’s ability to captivate listeners compels many to his artistry. Raised by his mother, Afeni Shakur, who was a member of the Black Panther Party, much of his upbringing likely influenced his music, which portrayed atrocities he experienced and witnessed as a Black man living in America. Shakur's stepfather Mutulu Shakur, who died in July, was a Black liberation activist known for his work in holistic health care for Black communities in New York City.
“I think he was genuinely someone who cares about the people — who had a message to deliver to Black people and poor people for a reason,” Di’lecarta said. His music, she said, also inspired her to learn more about Black history, and dive deeper into topics like the war on drugs.
Tupac often referred to Black leaders like Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and Huey P. Newton, whom critics often dismiss, Salimi said. His lyrics resonate decades after recording them, like after George Floyd’s killing, with songs like “Words of Wisdom,” illustrating the “problem of America,” which Shakur examined in his songs.
Warning: The following song contains some profanity.
“He’s a multifaceted human being,” Salimi said. “The prophetic witness was in that diagnostic that America has a lot of work to do.”
Salimi said Tupac is admired by young people, because his music “transcends space and time and it speaks to something that’s just a universal human trait — struggle, lamentation, justice, injustice, pursuit, hope.”

Shakur said it himself: “I’m not saying I’m going to rule the world or I’m going to change the world,” he said in a 1994 interview with MTV. “But I guarantee that I will spark the brain that will change the world. And that’s our job — is to spark somebody else watching us.”
While recent events — like Davis’ trial and references in Pinkett-Smith’s memoir “Worthy” — have brought more attention to Shakur’s name, “this stuff didn’t have to happen for Tupac to still be relevant,” Powell said. “He’s here.”
“There will be some new revelation, some new book, some new documentary,” he said. “It’s never going to end.”
While Tupac’s legacy varies for each person and their own experiences, it is infinite and incomparable.
“I just think there’s something beautiful about him and his music,” Salimi said. “His context. His art. His life. His legacy. His message. What he stood for. How he did it. How well he did it. That, to me, makes him unique — one of a kind.”

034cffd8-1dd6-4f84-9051-1b723f824af8,"High school teacher suspended for performing on porn website: ""I do miss my students""","St. Clair, Mo. — A Missouri high school teacher says she's been placed on leave after officials discovered that she was performing on a pornography website to supplement her salary.
Brianna Coppage, 28, who taught English at St. Clair High School, says her teaching days are probably over but acknowledges she knew the risks.
Coppage told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch she was put on leave after being interviewed by two administrators. Her access to school email and other software was suspended while the district investigates, she said.
""It was kind of always like this cloud hanging over my head, like I never knew when I would be discovered,"" Coppage said in an interview. ""Then, about two weeks ago, my husband and I were told that people were finding out about it. So I knew this day was coming.""
Superintendent Kyle Kruse said in a statement that the district was ""recently notified that an employee may have posted inappropriate media on one or more internet sites.""
""The district has engaged legal counsel to conduct a comprehensive investigation into this matter,"" Kruse wrote. ""Actions taken as a result of the investigation will be in accordance with board policy and with guidance from legal counsel.""
St. Clair is about 55 miles southwest of St. Louis. The high school has about 750 students.
Coppage said she joined the OnlyFans website over the summer to supplement her salary as a second-year teacher. She taught English to freshmen and sophomores and made about $42,000 last year, according to the newspaper's public pay database. She said she's earned an additional $8,000 to $10,000 per month performing on OnlyFans.
Coppage said she chose the site because its content is available only to subscribers and she thought it would help protect her identity. She said she didn't know how the district learned of her account but she it may have happened after she and her husband appeared in a recent video with two other OnlyFans performers who have a large following.
Coppage insisted no content was filmed or posted while she was on school grounds.
""I'm very aware that I am probably never going to teach again, but that was kind of the risk I knew I was taking. I am sad about that. I do miss my students,"" she said.
But Coppage said her account has gained about 100 new subscribers since word began to surface. She has more than doubled her subscription price and plans to continue posting on the site.
""I do not regret joining OnlyFans. I know it can be taboo, or some people may believe that it is shameful, but I don't think sex work has to be shameful,"" Coppage said. ""I do just wish things just happened in a different way."""

The Federal Aviation Administration urged U.S. airlines and pilots to use ""extreme caution"" when flying at any altitude in Israeli airspace, in an updated Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) statement issued early Sunday, following Hamas' large-scale surprise attack on Israel one day earlier.
The NOTAM mirrors a similar alert issued by the Israeli government.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared ""we are at war"" after Saturday's attack, which left hundreds dead and thousands more injured. More than 300 Palestinians have been killed in retaliatory Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, Palestinian health officials said Sunday.
""Due to the ongoing conflict situation in the region, between Israel and Gaza based extremist militants, operators are advised to review current security, threat information and NOTAMS,"" read the alert issued Saturday by the Israeli Civil Aviation Authority. It advised pilots to ""exercise caution"" and said delays were expected.
United Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines all announced that they have temporarily suspended flights to and from the international airport near Tel Aviv.
""Future operations at TLV will be suspended until conditions allow them to resume,"" United said in a statement to CBS News.

Both Delta and AA said in statements that operations to Israel had been suspended through at least Sunday.
""We will continue to monitor the situation with safety and security top of mind and will adjust our operation as needed,"" American Airlines said.
Delta added that it was ""working to safely transport Delta people back to the U.S. and will work with the U.S. government as needed to assist with the repatriation of U.S. citizens who want to return home.""
Also canceling flights were Air France, Lufthansa, Emirates, Ryanair and Aegean Airlines.
However, airport authorities did not stop commercial air links with Eilat, Israel's second international airport and tourist destination on the Red Sea.
""Given the current security situation in Tel Aviv, Lufthansa is canceling all flights to and from Tel Aviv up until and including Monday, a spokesman for the German carrier told AFP. The airline was ""monitoring the security situation in Israel,"" he added.
Brussels Airline, part of the Lufthansa group, also canceled its Tel Aviv flights.
Air France said it had halted Tel Aviv flights ""until further notice"".
""Commercial measures are in place, allowing customers to postpone or cancel their trip free of charge"", an Air France spokesman said.
Air France-KLM group's low-cost carrier Transavia announced it was canceling all flights from Paris and Lyon to Tel Aviv up to and including Monday. Spanish airline Iberia announced that its budget subsidiary Iberia Express was canceling its Tel Aviv flights.
Italy's flag-carrier ITA airways canceled its flight until Sunday morning at the earliest ""to protect the safety of passengers and crew.""

Modesto police said two customers got into an altercation inside. Then, the suspect left. When he returned, police said he fired multiple shots at the restaurant.
""He struck a business nearby that had patrons inside,"" said Modesto police spokesperson Sharon Bear.
The nearby business was a nail salon that had a boarded-up window on Wednesday.
""Thank God the police respond quickly,"" said Gerardo Hinojosa, who works at Dos Compadres. ""Everyone was safe.""
Bear said no customers or workers in either business were hit, but bullet marks were still visible on the restaurant's outside brick wall.
""Most crime in Modesto happens on the west side,"" said Whidby. ""It does not happen here in central Modesto.""
Investigators were out in west Modesto on Wednesday morning investigating a homicide. Bear told CBS13 the victim was a man parked in a car on Monticello Lane.
The two shootings, one deadly, happened fewer than 24 hours apart. CBS13 asked Bear if crime is up in Modesto.
""Modesto is a fairly safe community,"" Bear responded. ""We do have these isolated incidents as do a lot of cities.""
Bear said her team has a really high solve rate, solving all but one case in 2022.
""A lot of our crime statistics show that stolen vehicles are down in Modesto,"" said Bear.
Many people CBS13 spoke with in Modesto said crime happens everywhere, but these most recent incidents remind them to stay alert.
""I won't come here at night now that I know that that happened, but at the end of the day, they have the best food here,"" said Whidby.
Police arrested shooting suspect 47-year-old Paul Garcia at his Modesto home a little after the incident at Dos Compadres on Tuesday night. He is facing multiple charges including attempted homicide.
Police are still searching for the suspect in Wednesday morning's shooting on Monticello Lane just south of West Hatch Road. If you know anything, call Crime Stoppers at (209) 521-4636 or contact Detective Grant at grantj@modestopd.com."

A modern art museum in Germany has fired one of its employees after the facility said that they added a personal touch to an exhibit – their own art.
According to Munich newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, the self-proclaimed freelance artist was a 51-year-old man who worked in technical service at the Pinakothek der Moderne, a modern art museum that holds more than 20,000 pieces, including works by Pablo Picasso, René Magritte and Salvador Dalí – and for a short time, the employee.
The employee, who was not named in the local report, hung up a painting measuring almost 2 feet by 4 feet. A spokesperson for the museum told Süddeutsche Zeitung they weren't sure how long the painting was up, but that they don't believe it was up for very long. The man is said to have had access to the exhibit in which his art was hung outside opening hours.
""The supervisors notice something like this immediately,"" a spokesperson told the outlet.
The impromptu addition to the gallery was taken down and the man was fired, but the police are also investigating. According to the newspaper, the employee had drilled two holes into an empty hallway to hang the painting, which the police are investigating for the offense of property damage. Citing police, the newspaper said the man had hoped hanging the art would be his breakthrough to fame.
CBS News has reached out to the museum for comment.
The Pinakothek der Moderne is one of Europe's largest modern and contemporary art museums, housing four collections. The incident came just weeks after the opening of a new exhibit by the performance artist FLATZ, who in 1979 ""posed naked as a living dartboard,"" allowing spectators to throw darts at him, and in the early '90s swung upside down between steel plates, hitting the metal loudly for five minutes ""until he fell unconscious,"" the museum says.
""The exhibition is devoted to FLATZ's radical concept of the body that, in an unmistakable way, repeatedly addresses the sensitive and fragile as well,"" the museum says."

Security concerns have once again changed the plans for the memorial service of the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein, scheduled for San Francisco City Hall on Thursday.
The service was originally set to be a private service at the city's War Memorial and Performing Arts Center in Herbst Theatre, which had limited space. It was subsequently moved to the steps of City Hall steps to accommodate members of the public, who were invited to attend the outdoor service.
On Wednesday afternoon, Feinstein's office announced the service would no longer be open to the public because of increased security, and that only invited guests would have access to the service.
Adam Russell, a spokesperson for Feinstein's office, confirmed that the service would still be held outside, but noted the security perimeter will be too far back for the general public to see and hear.

Earlier Wednesday, an honor guard brought Feinstein's flag-draped casket into the City Hall rotunda where she was lying in state.
Aside from Vice President Kamala Harris, it is expected a number of U.S. Senators will be in attendance as Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the Senate would be out of session in observance of the memorial.
""The United States Senate will close in observance of the memorial of our late friend and colleague, Senator Dianne Feinstein,"" Schumer announced Wednesday. ""It will be my honor, a sad, tearful, but great honor to speak tomorrow at my friend, Dianne's memorial. I thank all my colleagues who will be in attendance. I know it would mean the world to her for her colleagues to join in this last one goodbye.""
Those wishing to view the memorial service can watch it online at sfgovtv.org/FeinsteinMemorial. CBS News Bay Area plans to provide coverage of the memorial service both on air and online. The senator will later be buried at a private, family-only ceremony.
Feinstein died Thursday at the age of 90, hours after casting her final vote in the U.S. Senate. The former San Francisco mayor was known for breaking multiple glass ceilings during her political career. She was first elected to the Senate in 1992 and became the longest-serving woman in the Senate, as well as the longest-serving senator in California history."

A sign nearby says there's no parking until Nov. 22, and that has some business owners worried.
""We're all apprehensive, terrified, but we must remain,"" said Robert Sorenson, owner of Bobby Bead.
""I'm going to have to get out there more, advertise more just to get, you know, bring more people in,"" said Marquita Winters, owner of Quitas Kloset.
""I think it is going to impact their businesses pretty dramatically,"" said Uptown resident Bill Babcock.
""Two years is a long time for a business to try to hang on for things to get better,"" Sorenson said.
The two-year project is split into phase one from West Lake Street to 26th Street, and phase two from 26th to Douglas Avenue.
""It just makes getting around more difficult is the biggest issue,"" Babcock said.

There are also plans to accommodate the future METRO E line and a new bus rapid transit line.
Lee says many of his customers walk, and he hopes others will figure out new parking spots to keep business rolling until the construction ends.
Metro Transit buses will be detoured to Lyndale Avenue. Business access will remain open, and traffic is restricted or closed depending on the block and the phase of construction. Pedestrian detours will continue evolving as the project does.

As a woman now in my 50s, I feel that Martha Stewart’s appearance is a reflection of the media’s pressure on women to look a certain way as we age. Why do we have to look at a model in her 80s without a single wrinkle – what’s real about that? We’ll start truly celebrating women when we recognise that with age comes much wisdom and experience. Let’s see that image on the front of more magazines.
I want to feel proud of my body as I get older and released from the ridiculous standards the media placed on me in my youth. My heart sank when I saw the photo in Sports Illustrated. Now we’re even being told how to age – just as I thought they weren’t interested in us any more. I see it as a cynical marketing ploy to access the consumer pounds of affluent members of society.

BALTIMORE- Playoff excitement is in the Baltimore air as the Orioles begin their journey to the World Series.
The Domino® Sugar Baltimore Refinery announced Saturday afternoon their iconic sign will light up differently as a tribute to the Orioles' post-season run. Only the border and each set of ""O"" and ""S"" on the sign will be illuminated.
Domino Sugar
According to a release, the sign will remain lit in this design every night for the duration of the O's 2023 postseason to celebrate the company's hometown team.
""Our team of more than 500 employees is pulling for the Orioles,"" said Peter O'Malley, Vice President of Corporate Relations of ASR Group, which owns the refinery. ""We couldn't think of a bigger or better way to show our appreciation and support for the O's.""
The iconic ""Domino Sugars"" sign, first placed on top of the refinery's packaging building in 1951, was renovated in 2021 to preserve the look of the original. It now features aluminum letters with energy-efficient LEDs, instead of neon.
Officials say the lights save 33,000 Kilowatt Hours per year and reduce more than 23 tons of carbon dioxide annually. The sign measures 70 by 120 feet, and each O stands 20 feet tall."

5f98ab64-9a53-463c-b93f-00a5c5bf3f8d,Coretta Scott King monument is one of few dedicated to women in U.S.,"A sculpture unveiled in honor of Coretta Scott King in Atlanta, Georgia, encourages people to make their voices heard — especially when more than 90 percent of monuments around the U.S. represent men.
The open-air dome, located in front of the King Center, is meant to be an immersive experience, and includes a podium of microphones, one of which is live, to amplify people's calls for positive change.
""She was a galvanizer, a coalition builder,"" said Bernice A. King, CEO of the King Center and daughter of Scott King and Martin Luther King, Jr. ""[She was] a master strategist, a champion for inclusion, a brave and selfless servant, a pioneer for peace, a warrior for the disenfranchised and marginalized.""
Scott King, who died in 2006, was a civil rights leader and advocate for equality. When her husband was assassinated in 1968, she dedicated her life to preserving his legacy and values, establishing the King Center that same year.
The sculpture has words such as ""empathy"" and ""freedom"" written on the outside of it, representing Scott King's core values. It's one of three sculptures going up in the U.S. that were commissioned by Hulu as part of its Made By Her campaign. A monument dedicated to environmentalist Marjory Stoneman Douglas will be unveiled in Miami, and one for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is scheduled for Los Angeles.
""There aren’t that many public sculptures to women, and there aren’t that many monument-builders who are women, ""said Saya Woolfalk, the artist behind all three sculptures.
Right now, fewer than eight percent of American public monuments depict women. Some research puts that statistic even lower, at six percent, if you count women who existed in real life. According to an audit by the Monument Lab, 22 feature mermaids. Of the top 50 historical figures presented in their audit, only three are women.
For the monument of Scott King, Woolfalk says she ""wanted to do something that really put you in her shoes, that made you feel her presence in the space.""
""You can speak your commitment to nonviolent social change, and that’s a really important part of the process,"" she said.
As a class of second graders from Jeffersonville Elementary School arrives at the Center for a field trip, many stood on their tippy-toes at the microphone to have the chance to belt out their own values.
""Every time someone gets hurt, or they get lost, I will help them find their way,"" said Alivia Thomas, 8.
""Love, peace, and courage,"" said Troy Pearson, 7. ""Courage is important.""
Courage and determination were two traits that represented Scott King the most, said her daughter, Bernice.
""Nothing could stop her,"" she said. ""She deposited so much in this world, from these grounds, and so her spirit is emanating from this place."""

A sporting goods company has since stepped up to help.
Ernest Radcliffe, who has coached baseball and football for, and mentored, hundreds of young people, was robbed at 6:06 p.m. Saturday at 61st Street and Ellis Avenue.
Coach Radcliffe was packing up his vehicle for baseball practice with buckets, bats, and uniforms.
""A black Kia sport pulled up, and two guys jumped out - and there was nothing I could do. They carjacked me. They jumped out on me. I didn't see it coming. I didn't know what to do,"" he said earlier this week. ""I couldn't pray. It was just all in one – it just happened so quick.""
Radcliffe said all happened in less than 30 seconds. At first, he was grateful his family wasn't present.
Radcliffe said he was also grateful ""for my life, because I could've been shot.""
His car was later been recovered.
""But, you know, they took a lot of stuff out the car – all my equipment; my bag - my red show bag with all my paperwork,"" Radcliffe told CBS 2 on Monday. ""I was working on some projects, calendars.""
Those items are still missing. But after hearing about his situation, Wilson Sporting Goods reached out to Radcliffe – and replaced all the stolen equipment for him.
Anyone who knows anything about this incident is asked to call Chicago Police."

When the wave of change rises, there are really only two options: Ride its power into a future of unparalleled opportunity or stand and watch as it crashes over you, destroying what you have built.
Of course, any surfer will tell you that in order to ride the wave, you must get out ahead of it.
Our role as leaders is to make our organizations surge-proof, and in the face of the AI revolution—and the potential for an infinitely more powerful artificial general intelligence (AGI)—that means enhancing the ""brain software"" of everyone in the organization.
This requires a learning revolution—an upgrade strategy for our neural software to keep us ahead of the AI tsunami, which the seismic forces of cybertech have already unleashed.
According to data reported by Statista, in the five years leading up to 2025, the annual sum total of data created, captured, copied and consumed globally is projected to increase to over 180 zettabytes, while the installed base of data-storage capacity was set to grow at a compound annual rate of 19.2% between 2020 and 2025.
It is this almost unimaginable increase in the availability of raw data that makes the deep learning of artificial intelligence (and, perhaps someday, AGI) possible. It has likely accelerated the development of AI platforms far beyond the timelines predicted even a few years ago.
On the other hand, the ubiquitous availability of information, in all its forms, has vastly inflated the value of our innate human ability to access, interpret and creatively manipulate that accumulated knowledge.
In the end, AI is a tool for progress, and like every other world-changing invention, those who adapt to it and develop the skills—and the mindset—to control its power will likely be the ones to ride its rising wave to success.
Futurist Alvin Toffler once wrote: ""The illiterate of the twenty-first century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn.""
As amazing as the new technologies may appear, no hardware yet invented—and nothing I've seen on the drawing boards of the think tanks in Silicon Valley, Bangalore or Shenzhen—comes close to the complexity, sophistication, and creative or associative power of the human brain. And, despite the hype, no algorithm yet written can enable that hardware to learn—or ""think""—as effectively as any human being.
Neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran described the human brain as ""the most complexly ordered structure in the universe"" with the number of potential brain states it can generate ""exceed[ing] the number of elementary particles in the known universe.""
So, we already possess the hardware and the potential for success, but the lesson that stands out for me is that human potential remains just that—potential—if it is not trained and nurtured.
To employ a computer analogy, no matter how much raw computing power a machine may possess—and no matter how many terabytes of data it may store or have access to—its potential is utterly dependent on the software we choose to run on it. If the software is inadequate, all that hardware and all that data could be wasted.
Education is the software that runs, and simultaneously upgrades, the human mind, and this is not limited to the period of ""formal education.""
This means that the same seismic changes that can render the old approaches to formal education obsolete also demand a revolution in the way that we, as leaders, need to think and plan in relation to the mindsets within our organizations.
In 2009, my long-time friend and collaborator Brian Caswell and I coined the phrase ""3-Mind Revolution"" because it had become clear to us that in a world of democratized access to information, the key differentiator would not be the traditional accumulation of knowledge but rather the development of mindsets.
Today’s workforce is made up of people whose education took place under a 20th-century system designed for an industrial society—a system that still holds sway today.
But if we are to build strong, resilient organizations that will successfully navigate the tidal fluctuations of 21st-century unpredictability, I believe that strength and resilience should be based upon the preparedness of every team member to stay ahead of the curve: to ""ride the wave."" They will likely need to, in Toffler’s words, ""learn, unlearn and relearn""—as often and as rapidly as possible.
No one is too old or too set in their ways to benefit from a ""software upgrade,"" and I believe that software for success is built around a ""3-Mind"" philosophy—developing the learning mind, the creative mind and (underpinning them both) the champion mind.
Learning is no longer just about memorization and rote. Rather, it is about making sense. Leaders should foster the learning mindset by encouraging employees to look for connection, see things within their context, apply mastered knowledge to specific needs and seek new knowledge to fill specific gaps.
Creativity is about asking the right questions and seeking solutions to the challenges most relevant to the immediate needs that drive us and our businesses. This works for both the artist and the workplace problem-solver (which is every one of us at some point).
A champion mindset faces the world with 100% respect but zero fear.
Respect, in this context, means a willingness to challenge accepted norms if necessity requires it, but not without first understanding why things are done the way they are and why that way may no longer work.
Fear—of change, of failure, etc.—is a virus ""mindset"" in the brain software that can infect the entire system, spreading from individual to individual and decapitating productivity.
Albert Einstein is credited (apocryphally, perhaps) with the observation that ""no problem can be solved from the same level of thinking that created it.""
In the age of AI, success isn't only about our team members' thinking; it's also about the mindset that enables them to ride the wave that swamps the rest.

c0c12f82-de46-441b-813b-4e69224945ee,"Convent-made Delicacies, a Christmas Favorite, Help Monks and Nuns Win Fans and Pay the Bills","MEXICO CITY (AP) — It’s the fortnight before Christmas and all through the world’s Catholic convents, nuns and monks are extra busy preparing the traditional delicacies they sell to a loyal fan base even in rapidly secularizing countries.
For many monastic communities, especially those devoted to contemplative life and with vows of poverty, producing cookies, fruitcakes, even beer for sale is the only means to keep the lights on.
But it’s also an enticing way to strengthen their ties with lay people who flock to their doors — and in some cases their websites — in the holiday season.
“Our kitchen is a witness to God’s love to those outside,” said Sister Abigail, one of the 10 cloistered nuns of the Perpetual Adorers of the Most Blessed Sacrament in Mexico City.
“We are in the Lord’s presence, and we’re always thinking that it will make someone happy, the person who will eat this, or they will gift it and someone will receive it with joy,"" added the sister, whose convent makes sweets, eggnog and its bestseller, tamales.
Most monasteries have to be financially self-sufficient. Many in countries like Spain have to maintain not only an aging, shrinking cohort of monks and nuns, but also monumental, centuries-old buildings, said Fermín Labarga, a professor of church history at the University of Navarra in Pamplona.
Since the small-scale farming with which they supported themselves for centuries stopped being profitable decades ago, most have turned to crafts, including the wildly popular gourmet food production that uses only homemade ingredients and recipes passed down generations.
“An immense majority of people goes to buy the nuns’ sweets,” said Pipa Algarra, who in her 90 years in the southern Spanish city of Granada has come to know each of the dozens of convents’ specialties. Among the oldest is alfajor, a cookie with roots dating back more than a thousand years when this region was a Muslim kingdom, while this year’s novelty is sushi rolls introduced by Filipino sisters.
“The nuns, aside from supporting themselves with this, make really good sweets. And the prayer that comes with it is priceless,” added Algarra, who remembers as a child going to convents with her friends to get dough trimmings from the Communion wafers the nuns also produced.
As a cloistered order, the 14 Poor Clares sisters in Carmona, Spain, have to work to earn their daily bread — in their case, making some 300 “English cakes” and 20 other kinds of sweets a month to sell at their 15th-century convent turnstile, said the abbess, Veronicah Nzula.
There’s a summer slowdown when southern Spain is so sweltering nobody takes coffee breaks with cookies, Nzula quipped. But the production revs up for Christmas as the sweets are also sold at a special market devoted to convent products in nearby Seville.
“While we work, we pray the rosary and we think of the people who will eat each sweet,” said Nzula. She learned the recipes from older sisters after arriving more than 20 years ago from Kenya, like all but one of the current sisters.
Most nuns and monks involved in preparing the delicacies are quick to point out that their main mission is to pray, not to cook — and that doing both involves finding a delicate balance.
“We brew to live, we don’t live to brew,” said Brother Joris, who supervises the brewery at Saint-Sixtus Abbey in Westvleteren, Belgium. “There needs to be equilibrium between monastic life and economic life. We don’t want to end up as a brewery with a little abbey on the side.”
For that reason, production remains limited even though the beer brings the monks’ only income — and it’s considered by connoisseurs one of the choicest brews in the world, especially popular as a Christmas and Father’s Day gift.
Monks started making it in the 1830s to supply lay workers building the abbey with the daily pint their contract guaranteed. Aficionados still need to come to the abbey or its cafe to get their crate, giving the contemplative order a chance to bear witness too.
“By simply existing, we remind people ‘they’re still here,’” Brother Joris said.
A fellow Trappist at the Abbey of Gethsemani in Kentucky — where the renowned monk and author Thomas Merton once lived — similarly said that producing their bourbon-infused delicacies is just a part of the “ora et labora” (work and pray) commitment under St. Benedict’s rule.
“Our ideal is to pray always,” said Brother Paul Quenon, who joined the abbey in the late 1950s when the bourbon fruitcake was already being produced, and has worked on the more recently introduced bourbon fudge.
The abbey now makes some 60,000 pounds per year of each, most sold between Thanksgiving and Christmas — when the bakery is so busy that silent prayer becomes a challenge.
To also strike a balance, the two dozen Benedictine sisters at the 15th-century Monastery of San Paio de Antealtares in Santiago de Compostela, one of Europe’s top pilgrimage cities, only work on sweets in the morning.
“It’s not the purpose of our life, lest we break the equilibrium — rather, it’s to turn work into prayer,” said the abbess, Almudena Vilariño. “When I’m working, I pray that these sweets may be catalysts of union and peace in the house or office where they will go.”
Following the same recipe dating from the late 1700s, the nuns make their signature almond cake known as tarta de Santiago. A few decades ago, local women would bring ingredients to the convent so the nuns could bake cakes in their wooden oven. Today, pilgrims from around the world who have finished their “camino” in the magnificent cathedral across the square are among the crowds ringing the bell by the nuns’ simple wooden turnstile.
“The turnstile puts in touch the interior world with the exterior. They’re not disconnected,” Labarga said.
Back in Mexico City, the sisters preparing their popular Christmas buñuelos — a sort of flat donut made with flour, water and cinnamon — also connect their community labor with their faith. During the Advent season, they pray thousands of Hail Marys as they roll the dough or cover the sweets with sugar.
“This is how we live the liturgy,” Sister Abigail said. “This is the objective in our work, and work for people outside the convent — that we feed them, and they help us so we can eat.”

148d3b8b-5b6b-4218-a706-be4dff55cc64,"Roku says 576,000 streaming accounts compromised in recent security breach","Roku says some accounts compromised Roku says 576,000 streaming accounts compromised in second breach 02:34
Just weeks after a security hack exposed more than 15,000 Roku accounts, the company said Friday that a second security breach impacted more than 576,000 accounts.
In a statement on its website, the company said it found no evidence that it was the source of the account credentials used in either of the attacks or that Roku's systems were compromised. Instead, the company said, login credentials used in the hacks were likely stolen from another source for which the affected users may have used the same username and password. This type of cyberattack is known as ""credential stuffing.""
Roku said in fewer than 400 cases, the ""malicious actors logged in and made unauthorized purchases of streaming service subscriptions and Roku hardware producing using the payment store in these accounts, but they did not gain access to any sensitive information, including full credit card numbers or other full payment information.""

The company said it reset the passwords for all affected accounts and notified those customers directly about the incident. It is refunding or reversing charges in the accounts that purchases made by unauthorized actors.
In addition, the company also enabled two-factor authentication for all Roku accounts, even those that have not been impacted by either security incident They said account holders should be aware that the next time they log into the Roku account online, a verification link will be sent to the associated email.
""While the overall number of affected accounts represents a small fraction of Roku's more than 80 (million) active accounts, we are implementing a number of controls and countermeasures to detect and deter future credential stuffing incidents,"" the company said.
Roku encouraged users to create a ""strong, unique password"" for their account and also advised them to ""remain vigilant,"" being alert to any ""suspicious communications appearing to come from Roku, such as requests to update your payment details, share your username or password, or click on suspicious links.""
""We sincerely regret that these incidents occurred and any disruption they may have caused,"" the company said. ""Your account security is a top priority, and we are committed to protecting your Roku account.""
This is the second Roku breach in recent months. In March, Roku said hackers accessed more than 15,000 user accounts."

Why it matters: The IRA and infrastructure law are linchpins of Biden's reelection campaign — but it's proving tough to get people excited about climate spending when so many are unaware of both measures.
Driving the news: Former House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer acknowledged that Democrats' achievements from the last Congress aren't ""showing up in the polls"" because ""people continue to be fixated, as any family would be, on gasoline prices [and] on grocery prices.""
""Part of our challenge is we did so much and the inclination is to tell people how broad it is, but they, I'm sure, get overwhelmed by this,"" Hoyer told Axios.
Rep. Lori Trahan added: ""You could argue the president was almost too successful in getting his priorities across the finish line.""
Context: A WaPo-led poll conducted in July found that only 3 in 10 Americans had heard of the Inflation Reduction Act.
The next month, a WSJ poll of registered voters found more than half believed Biden did not have a ""strong record of accomplishments.""
Republicans say the IRA isn't popular because it's riddled with flaws.
Democrats ""sold hard-working Americans a bill of goods,"" said Steven Law, the Senate Leadership Fund's CEO, in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. ""They promised an economic panacea; what we got is looming job losses and higher prices.""
Threat level: IRA awareness isn't just an electoral issue. It's necessary for the law to succeed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions.
Key IRA programs, including efficiency rebates and the EV consumer tax credit, rely heavily on consumer awareness.
Unlike the Affordable Care Act, the IRA didn't fund any system to engage with Americans to help them understand how they can benefit from the law, said Ari Matusiak, CEO of Rewiring America, a nonprofit that promotes home electrification.
Groups like Rewiring are picking up the slack through offerings like a household electrification savings calculator.
""There's a big difference between reaching people and them ultimately taking an action,"" he said, ""but a big piece of this is just educating people about what's available to them.""
What they're saying: Asked about the message to market these laws, Democrats pointed to individual projects in their districts.
""The only way to sell it is to show people the on-the-ground effect of all of this,"" Rep. Dan Kildee told Axios.
Zoom in: Hoyer is running an operation to try to sell those achievements — the Regional Leadership Council. Its cadre of members, including Trahan, meets regularly with administration officials and other lawmakers to coordinate data sharing and sales tactics.
Some of the RLC's work has included preparing info sheets that map out individual infrastructure and manufacturing investments by congressional district.
The RLC is trying to make sure the Biden administration and lawmakers who could benefit from IRA projects in their districts are amplifying the benefits cohesively, said Rep. Jared Huffman.
""We've got to look for those examples and really lift them up, but then talk about the bigger thing that's happening economywide — the industrial policy shift that is going to bring even more and more of that good news our way,"" said Huffman, an RLC member.
The big picture: In 2024, the IRA might be about motivating the base rather than convincing swing voters.
""The scale of this election is going to be the same as it was last time,"" said Nick Abraham, senior state communications director at LCV. ""Protecting the most we've ever done on climate is incredibly important.""
An example of that messaging: LCV put up ads targeting GOP lawmakers in New York and California who voted for H.R. 1, the House Republican energy bill.
Of note: Biden's creation of the American Climate Corps might be a bigger selling point for younger progressives than the IRA, said Michele Weindling, electoral director for the Sunrise Movement."

Texas-based Microvast was one of 20 companies to win preliminary grants totaling $2.8 billion to boost domestic manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles. The company is building a battery plant in Tennessee and was in talks with the Energy Department for a $200 million grant funded through the 2021 infrastructure law.
A spokeswoman for Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm confirmed Tuesday that negotiations with Microvast were canceled, but did not offer a specific reason.
The Energy Department said in a statement that it “maintains a rigorous review process prior to the release of any awarded funds, and it is not uncommon for entities selected to participate in award negotiations” to ultimately be denied a federal grant.
“The department can confirm that it has elected to cancel negotiations and not to award Microvast funds from this competitive funding opportunity,” spokeswoman Charisma Troiano said.
The company did not immediately return a request for comment.
Republicans and Democrats praised the department’s decision.
“This is a win for taxpayers and American businesses,” House Science Committee Chairman Frank Lucas, R-Oklahoma said in a statement. “On no account should our tax dollars be funding a company with substantial ties to the Chinese Communist Party. These funds are intended to strengthen America’s battery production and supply chain, not to tighten China’s stranglehold on these supplies.”
Lucas and other Republicans said they were frustrated that it took more than six months for the Biden administration “to come to such an obvious conclusion.” Lucas and other GOP lawmakers have repeatedly complained about what they call Microvast’s links to the Chinese Communist Party.
New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said the decision to rescind the grant “shows that the DOE is taking its stewardship of taxpayer money very seriously.″
At a Senate Energy Committee hearing in February, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., questioned whether the planned grant to Microvast would benefit China. Barrasso cited a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in which Microvast said it may not be able to protect its intellectual property rights in China.
China often requires foreign companies to partner with Chinese businesses in order to operate in the country.
In a May 1 letter to Granholm, Barrasso said Microvast’s CEO had “bragged to Chinese media about Microvast’s strong ties to the People’s Republic of China.”
The 2021 infrastructure law “was ostensibly intended to develop robust domestic manufacturing bases and supply chains” for electric vehicles and other clean energy, Barrasso said. “DOE’s distribution of $200 million in taxpayer funds to a company joined at the hip with China” would be “demonstrably antithetical to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s intent,” he added.
Barrasso called the Microvast grant an example of “the Solyndra Syndrome,” a reference to an Obama-era program that disbursed more than $500 million in loan guarantees to the failed solar company Solyndra. He and other Republicans said both cases demonstrated poor vetting by Democratic administrations.
The loan program largely went dormant under President Donald Trump but has been revived by President Joe Biden. It is separate from infrastructure law funding that was conditionally awarded to Microvast and other companies.
Grants announced in October were intended to help U.S. companies extract and process lithium, graphite and other battery materials. The Biden administration is seeking to boost production and sales of electric vehicles as a key part of Biden’s strategy to slow climate change and build up U.S. manufacturing.
“This is critically important, because the future of vehicles is electric,″ Biden said at a White House event last year. The Energy Department grants - along with other spending approved in the 2022 climate law - are a bid “to make sure we’re back in the (battery production) game in a big way,″ Biden said."
46cf7cdb-1902-4376-a32f-f9e19f296cc1,New Jersey's primary ballot system at issue in race for Sen. Robert Menendez's seat,"TRENTON, N.J. -- A battle is brewing among New Jersey Democrats running for fellow Democrat Robert Menendez's U.S. Senate seat.
Menendez, who has said he has not ruled out running as an independent, is facing corruption charges.
Among the candidates are the first lady of New Jersey and a congressman, who wants to change the state's primary ballot system.
Congressman Andy Kim was in federal court on Monday, arguing primary ballots used in 19 of 21 counties violate his constitutional rights and put him at a disadvantage against one candidate.
""Well, Tammy Murphy is the candidate that's getting substantial advantage here in this race,"" Kim said.
Tammy Murphy, Gov. Phil Murphy's wife, has received Democratic county chair endorsements in large counties like Bergen and Passaic, which use what's called the county line ballot system.
""When she first jumped in ... beyond getting the county chair endorsements from a number of counties, eight or nine counties, at that time. I mean, a number of these county chairs never even returned my phone calls, never gave me a chance, and certainly, right out of the gate, there was unfairness to that system,"" Kim said.
County chair-endorsed candidates have their names appear in a row or column on a county line ballot. In an old sample ballot, Sen. Cory Booker's name fell under Joe Biden's, associating him with the president.
Kim and other groups want every county to use an office block format ballot, where candidates seeking the same office have their names appear in the same box.
""We are on this case because we believe New Jersey needs representative democracy,"" said Antoinette Miles, state director of New Jersey Working Families.
CBS New York reached out to Tammy Murphy's campaign, but did not immediately hear back.
Attorneys representing some county clerks in federal court said Kim didn't mind it when he had the coveted spot on the county line ballot.
Joanne Raijoppi, Union County's clerk, said it's too late to change ballots for the June 4 primary.
""There are many, many steps involved. The time frame is very close,"" Raijoppi said. ""The bigger concern for me is the voter, you know? The voter is used to the old ballot.""
Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said Kim's fight is part of the reason he's now supporting the congressmen and ditching his endorsement of the first lady. Fulop told CBS New York he's disappointed with Tammy Murphy's candidacy.
""Every county has its own convention. Every convention has been frustrating to watch one week, worse than previous,"" Fulop said. ""There is a sense of entitlement we couldn't have predicted six months ago and a reluctance to kind of speak about that.""
The judge is expected to make a ruling as early as next week and there is somewhat of a deadline. Officials would have to start the process of changing those ballots by April 20.
This past weekend, New Jersey's attorney general also sent a letter to the judge in the case, saying he will not defend the county line ballot system in court."
837d0745-c485-4612-8502-2b42208d5c7b,Biden Urged to Disclose Taxpayer Money Diverted from Veterans to Illegals,"Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) is demanding that President Joe Biden’s top agencies disclose how much taxpayer money has been siphoned from American veterans to illegal aliens who have recently arrived in the United States.
For years now, Biden’s top agencies have been accused of diverting Veterans Affairs (VA) services from veterans to provide healthcare services to recently arrived illegal aliens.
In a letter sent to VA Secretary Denis McDonough, Blackburn asked the agency to disclose the amount of taxpayer dollars that have been diverted from veterans to shore up resources for illegal aliens at the U.S.-Mexico border.
“How much funding has the VA allocated specifically for the medical care or veterans’ benefits (including claims processing) for illegal immigrants, including but not limited to those in ICE detention facilities or those who were deported?” Blackburn writes.
Blackburn noted reports that suggested in Fiscal Year 2022, taxpayers paid nearly $95 million in medical expenses for illegal aliens in federal custody that “should have been used to support American veterans who bravely served this nation,” Blackburn asserts:
Additionally, in Fiscal Year 2021, Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) healthcare arm budgeted more than $74 million for the VA’s contractor to assist with outside referrals and medical claims processing. [Emphasis added] Yet at the same time, veterans and their families are rewarded for their sacrifice with months- and years-long waiting times for their claims to be processed. Currently, 1,048,765 veterans are waiting for staff to process their claims. The VA claims that the average wait time for a claim to be processed is about five months; yet the agency’s own data shows that its backlog has increased and is expected to grow this year. [Emphasis added] The VA was created to support those who have served and protected this nation, and now senior VA officials have seemingly placed these veterans on a tier below the flood of illegal immigrants that are crossing our porous border. Since President Biden took office, more than 8.5 million illegal immigrants, including 1.7 million known “gotaways” have entered our country. Hundreds of individuals on the terror watchlist have been caught at our border, including 30 since the start of Fiscal Year 2024. This problem will continue to grow as Secretary Mayorkas continues to turn a willfully blind eye towards the crisis at our southern border. [Emphasis added] It is unacceptable to see the VA redirect its resources away from those who defended this country in favor of those who flout its laws without remorse. As such, I ask that the VA immediately stop allocating its resources to the care and claims of illegal immigrants. [Emphasis added]
Blackburn similarly wants to know if VA officials “received a specific directive from the Biden administration to provide medical care or veterans’ benefits to illegal immigrants” as well as what federal laws and regulations allow for such a transfer of services from veterans to illegal aliens.
Last month, Rep. Mike Bost (R-IL) and Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) introduced the “No VA Resources for Illegal Aliens Act” to block the VA from using its resources to provide healthcare services to illegal aliens.
Reps. Jack Bergman (R-MI), Scott Franklin (R-FL), and Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-IA) are co-sponsoring the bill in the House, while Blackburn (R-TN) and Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) are cosponsoring the bill in the Senate.

First, let's talk rain.
I don't need to reiterate how wet it's been over the last few weeks. The ground has been so wet that even a garden-variety shower could be enough to cause flooding. Add in deep-convective, training thunderstorms, and it's a recipe for a disaster.
Most areas in Worcester and Middlesex County picked up between 1-3"", which at a fast enough rain rate, was enough to flood roads and strand cars. Multiple roads in Fitchburg, for instance, were left in shambles after rushing water buckled the asphalt.

Massachusetts also picked up its first tornado in 682 days, when an EF-0 tornado touched down in North Brookfield just before 11am. According to the National Weather Service office out of Norton, the tornado was on the ground for a non-continuous 2 miles path, had a width of about 250 yards, and maximum wind speed of about 80 mph.
The tornado knocked down a few trees and powerlines, causing some to lose power.
The last time Massachusetts was hit by a tornado was September 2, 2021, courtesy of the remnants of Hurricane Ida. That tornado hit Dennis, and was an EF-0 twister.

Fortunately, looking ahead, there is drier weather in store as we start the work week. Sunshine and near 90 for areas inland will certainly help any clean-up efforts.

But the manager knows the ropes - he knows how to get results in the Premier League. He's proved it over many years.
They have to show resilience, like they did at Sheffield United, and they missed a couple of sitters against Fulham and lost the game. They have been in and around games but certainly they will have to do better.
Tactically, I do not think it will be much different at Brentford. Could they be a bit more progressive? They may be a little braver in possession but I do not think they will be a million miles from how they have been setting up.
That's Sean Dyche. With the squad he has, he will feel he has to be quite rigid to get the points they need.
As for Everton fans, they are going to need a couple of results soon as they are getting frustrated. But Dyche came to the club in the first place to get them over the line - and he did.
That is what we are going to see.

By all accounts, the economy is empirically doing well. Inflation is down. GDP is up from a rate of 4.2% to 5.2% in the third quarter, and unemployment is at a consistent low. Yet, a recent report from the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey suggests that Americans believe the economy is in a worse state than it was during the pandemic. But how can this be?
Despite the empirical truth, our perspective reality seems out of step with…well…reality. This revelation has significant and obvious political implications. If someone believes the economy is doing well, they are more likely to view the current administration more favorably than someone who thinks otherwise. Because of their relative perspectives, they will likely vote accordingly. Politicians and political pundits know this all too well, so they go to great lengths to frame the view that most aligns with their political leanings in hopes of influencing voting behavior.
That’s the thing about the “truth;” it’s not as objective as we would like to believe. As the novelist Anaïs Nin is famously quoted, “We don’t see things as they are, we see them as we are.” That is to say, the world manifests based on our subjective perspectives, not on empirical objectivity. That’s why some perceive the economy as worse than it verifiably is. Things aren’t the way they are; they are the way that we are—and the way we are informs the way we vote, what we buy, and just about everything we do.
Just like politics, our subjective perspectives impact consumption as well. The meanings projected onto brands and branded products are equally subjective, maybe even more so considering the signifying nature of brands and their role in helping us make purchase decisions and achieve our desired identity projects. That’s likely why it’s easier for voters to choose a candidate when they know the party—brand—they belong to. This helps them understand if the candidate—product—is for someone like themselves. Brands do the same thing for consumer products based on the associated meanings they hold in the hearts and minds of people.

Meaning is subjective and collectively held in the minds of people, not in the hands of marketers—because marketers don’t make meaning; people do. Meaning is socially negotiated and constructed through the discourse in which we engage with our people. Whether in the office, in the sanctuary, or in the group chat, our exchanges and observations influence each other’s perspectives and subsequent behaviors.
This phenomenon is accelerated when we consider the prevalence of today’s technology and its prolific productions. We talk more and see more of each other, which creates more opportunities for people to contribute to the meaning-making process and, ultimately, be influenced by it. Our people are shaping and molding our opinions on new products, music, policies, and the like.
The Pew Center estimates that over half of American adults get their news from social networking platforms. This suggests that news stories like the economy are contextualized by the news outlet and the people who share them. There is both an implicit and explicit framing when these stories are shared by our people, which influences how the topic is translated and collectively perceived.

Suppose our people think negatively about a topic and express it as such in the public discourse across social networking sites. In this case, we are also more likely to adopt a similar perspective—despite the objective truth. This is what we’re seeing in the case of the economy as well. The dominant perspective in the social discourse is that the economy is bad, so people think things must be bad.
The same thing goes for brands and branded products. Is there any real difference between Duracell and Amazon Basics batteries? Is Apple iOS a superior operating system? Is the Telsa Cybertruck worth the ticket price? Does Tide get more stains out than its competitors? These answers are being negotiated in the social discourse and reworked into our consumption behavior, regardless of what the empirical evidence may suggest.

There is a lesson to be learned for marketers or anyone with a vested interest in getting people to take action. The influence of our perceived realities has a greater impact on human behavior than objective reality because our lived experiences are in no way objective. As the cultural anthropologist Grant McCracken puts it, our perspectives are culturally constituted, where everyday experiences present themselves to our senses fully shaped and confirmed by our beliefs and assumptions.
As we observe our people traverse the social world and weigh in on the social discourse, they give us cues for how we should see the world and move accordingly. This cultural practice is the process by which people establish perspectives and their version of reality, which influences their opinion on the economy and how they view brands and branded products.
Therefore, it’s not enough for marketers to tell consumers their products are good or that their brands are cool; they must inspire people to tell their people. It’s not enough for us to say it; they need to hear it in the group chat or see it in their feed. This isn’t “influencer” marketing; it’s marketing—full stop.
The job of marketing is to influence human behavior, and there’s nothing more influential to human behavior than our people. As such, our marketing activity should be designed to catalyze social discourse in hopes of igniting the meaning-making process that informs perspective and drives behavioral adoption. Like the economy, it doesn’t matter how well your product performs; if my people say it’s no good, it must be so."

However, in his own third season in 2022, Jefferson was the Offensive Player of the Year, racking up 1,809 yards on 128 catches – both of which led the NFL – with eight touchdowns in 17 games.
Chase does have a Rookie of the Year under his belt, but so does Jefferson. The Vikings star also has one more Pro Bowl than Chase, collecting three in four seasons.
However, the former teammates feel they are both the best in the NFL, and it is never worth the debate when it is brought up – at least in Chase’s eyes.
""Nah, that’s pointless. We do this every year with each other,"" he said.
Ask anyone and more names will likely come to mind, but it is hard not to have Miami Dolphins stud Tyreek Hill when making that list.
The speedster leads the NFL with 1,542 yards and 12 receiving touchdowns in 13 games, with his latest leaving him sidelined with an ankle injury for quite some time before returning. He still managed to catch four of his five targets for 61 yards.
Other receivers like Dallas Cowboys’ CeeDee Lamb, Philadelphia Eagles’ A.J. Brown, Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ Mike Evans and many more can make their case as the tip of the iceberg in NFL receiver production.

However, the fact of the matter is that it is in the eye of the beholder. So, in Chase’s view, he is the best and that thought process will not be changing so long as he steps foot on an NFL field."
727803c9-55d9-4f56-b6aa-4db5de3519c5,Stars extend winning streak to season-high 5 games with 4-1 victory over Kings,"Radek Faksa and Jason Robertson scored 18 seconds apart in the second period, Joe Pavelski had a goal and an assist, and the Dallas Stars extended their winning streak to a season-high five games by beating the Los Angeles Kings 4-1 on Saturday night.
""We wanted to end the trip right. We wanted this to be the best game of the trip. We knew it would have to be considering the opponent, and I thought we put in a great effort,"" Stars coach Pete DeBoer said.
Wyatt Johnston added a power-play goal nearly seven minutes into the third period. The Stars are ninth in the NHL with the man advantage with a 24% conversion rate, but they've taken that to another level during their winning streak by going 7 for 19. Pavelski added an empty-net goal.
Scott Wedgewood stopped 26 shots in his first game since Feb. 26. The win keeps Dallas atop the Central Division with 89 points, four ahead of Winnipeg and Colorado.
""Lately, power play has been doing well. Line's been producing. Joe's been making a lot of plays. I think Roope (Hintz) is using his speed a lot more right now. Kind of feeding off that, so I think our team in general is playing well,"" said Robertson, who also had an assist and is on a six-game point streak with three goals and five assists.
The Kings got off to a great start when Kevin Fiala scored 26 seconds into the game, but they weren't able to sustain the momentum.
Fiala has 10 points (five goals, five assists) in the last six games. The Kings continue to struggle at home with a 13-11-7 mark and are tied for third in the Pacific Division with Vegas at 75 points after the Golden Knights beat Detroit.
Cam Talbot made 31 saves.
In what could be a possible first-round playoff matchup, the Stars have won seven of the last nine against the Kings and outscored them 9-2 in the two meetings this season. They face each other again on March 16 in Dallas.
""They beat us handily both times. I thought we were ready for them. They shouldn't have caught us off guard because they already gave us a licking (5-1 in Dallas on Jan. 16). Give them credit, they came in and outplayed us. In every area of the game,"" Kings interim coach Jim Hiller said. ""To beat a team like that, you've got to play a playoff-style game. We didn't have it in us.""
Fiala, who had the game-winning goal in overtime against Ottawa on Thursday night, wasted no time putting the Kings in the lead. On the opening shift, he drove to the net and redirected Drew Doughty's pass from near the boards and along the left faceoff circle past Wedgewood for his 21st goal of the season. It was also the fastest goal scored by Fiala in his 10-year career.
Faksa fired a snap shot from high in the slot at 10:34 to tie it 1-all. Three of Faksa's six goals have come in the past four games. On the ensuing rush up ice, Robertson put in a rebound after Pavelski's shot went off Talbot's leg pads. It was Robertson's 22nd and third in the last five games.
Los Angeles forward Adrian Kempe returned to the lineup after missing five games due to an arm injury.

It’s the time of year when marketers alike attempt to forecast the foreseeable future. As 2024 nears, we spend considerable time and effort planning and preparing how to best reach and connect with audiences and how to make a lasting and impactful impression.
Anticipating future marketing trends is a crucial and valuable part of the process and strategy. In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and continuously shifting consumer behaviors, staying updated with the latest marketing trends has become paramount. According to a report from VidenGlobe, “The year 2024 … is a time filled with opportunities and challenges we have never seen before.” In other words, running a business today means understanding how innovative strategies can benefit your company’s needs.
1. Conversational Marketing And AI-Driven Interactions
As we tread deeper into 2024, conversational marketing is poised to redefine customer interactions. Gone are the days when customers would wait patiently for responses; the modern consumer seeks immediate gratification and instant solutions.
Through AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants, brands are engaging consumers in real time, answering queries and guiding purchasing decisions. Such AI-driven conversations provide a seamless and personalized experience, increasing customer satisfaction and, consequently, conversions.
2. Virtual Reality And Augmented Reality Integration
The border between the digital realm and reality is becoming increasingly porous, thanks to advancements in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). These technologies offer marketers a unique opportunity to create immersive brand experiences. Whether it’s a VR showroom tour for a car company or an AR app that lets users visualize how furniture will look in their home, the possibilities are virtually limitless. As VR and AR hardware become more accessible, expect to see brands incorporating these technologies into their marketing campaigns.
3. Sustainability And Ethical Marketing
The modern consumer is not just interested in purchasing a product or service; they’re keen on understanding the brand’s values, particularly concerning environmental and social responsibility. This trend, spurred by global challenges like climate change and social injustices, has led to a surge in brands promoting their sustainability initiatives and ethical practices. From eco-friendly packaging to fair trade sourcing, marketing in 2024 is as much about values as it is about value.
4. Hyper-Personalization Through Big Data And Analytics
Today’s consumer expects tailor-made experiences. With the vast amount of data available from various touchpoints—be it social media, websites or even physical stores—brands can harness this information using sophisticated analytics. This results in hyper-personalized marketing strategies where content, product recommendations and even advertisements are customized for individual consumers. As big data technologies and machine learning algorithms evolve, I believe this trend will only become more refined, making mass marketing strategies increasingly obsolete.
5. Video Marketing And Short-Form Content Dominance
While video marketing isn’t new, its dominance has been compounded by the rise of platforms like TikTok, YouTube Shorts and similar short-form video platforms. The ephemeral nature of this content, combined with its engaging visual appeal, aligns perfectly with the dwindling attention spans of modern audiences. Brands are now leveraging short-form videos not just for advertisements but for storytelling, product launches and even customer testimonials.
Conclusion
The marketing world in 2024 is an exciting blend of technology and human-centric approaches. Brands that harness the power of conversational AI, immersive technologies like VR and AR, and the resonance of ethical practices, while staying attuned to the nuances of personalization and the potency of short-form content, are set to thrive. In a landscape that evolves almost daily, adaptability and innovation remain the cornerstones of marketing success.

9fd9bd5c-9322-4fc4-81dd-b647b0923dc5,US targets network financing Iran-backed Houthi attacks on shipping vessels,"The U.S. is imposing sanctions on one individual and three money exchange houses in Yemen and Turkey accused of ""facilitating the flow of Iranian financial assistance to Houthi forces and their destabilizing activities.""
""Today’s action underscores our resolve to restrict the illicit flow of funds to the Houthis, who continue to conduct dangerous attacks on international shipping and risk further destabilizing the region,"" Brian E. Nelson, under secretary of the treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a press release.
""The United States, along with our allies and partners, will continue to target the key facilitation networks that enable the destabilizing activities of the Houthis and their backers in Iran.""
The Treasury Department says Nabil Al-Hadha has facilitated the transfer of millions of dollars to Yemen's Iran-backed Houthis at the direction of Sa’id al-Jamal, who had previously been sanctioned for his affiliation with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF).
IRAN-BACKED HOUTHIS ATTACK ANOTHER CONTAINER SHIP TRANSITING RED SEA
On Tuesday, Mediterranean Shipping Co. (MSC) said one of its container ships was attacked while transiting the Red Sea.

The Swiss-based company said its container ship MSC United VIII was attacked around 12:25 UTC while en route from King Abdullah Port, Saudi Arabia, to Karachi, Pakistan.
Houthi militia claimed to have fired missiles at the vessel without saying it was struck.
Attacks on vessels traveling the Red Sea have skyrocketed following Israel’s offensive against Hamas in response to the militant group’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel that left 1,200 dead and hundreds of others injured.
Major shipping companies, including Denmark-based giant Maersk, have been avoiding the Red Sea and sending ships around Africa and the Cape of Good Hope, adding costs and delays.

""The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior,"" the U.S. Department of Treasury said in its release. ""The Houthis’ continued attacks against international shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden have sharply curtailed the free flow of commerce through the region and represent a clear violation of international law.""

That was the claim Monday when party organizers boasted they had $117 million on hand, making it the largest sum for any Democratic candidate in history at this point in the race.
The Hill reports the president and vice president’s 2024 campaign team said it raised more than $97 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The total includes fundraising efforts by the campaign, joint fundraising committees and the Democratic National Committee. The report sets out:
In the third quarter of 2023, the Biden-Harris campaign announced it raised more than $71 million and had nearly $91 million cash on hand. The team raised more than $72 million in the second quarter of last year, with $77 million cash.
The campaign stressed grassroots fundraising efforts in the fourth quarter contributed to the haul and applauded the historic achievement, the report continues.
“This historic haul — proudly powered by strong and growing grassroots enthusiasm—sends a clear message: the Team Biden-Harris coalition knows the stakes of this election and is ready to win this November,” Julie Chávez Rodríguez, Biden-Harris campaign manager, said in a statement announcing the numbers as seen by The Hill.
“Across our coalition, we are seeing early, sustained support that is helping us scale our growing operation across the country and take our message to the communities that will determine this election,” Chavez added.
The Democratic Party does not have a “plan B” if President Joe Biden does not run for reelection “for any reason,” establishment media outlets reported. https://t.co/U1xWAmFaaw — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) December 3, 2023
The amount represents the sum total of four entities: Biden’s campaign, his two joint fundraising committees and the Democratic National Committee.
The Biden-Harris campaign said 97 percent of donations in the fourth quarter were less than $200, for an average of $41.88.
Since the campaign’s launch, aides said, almost one million supporters have made contributions, for more than 2.3 million total contributions, The Hill report concluded.
Former President Donald Trump, Biden’s increasingly likely rival in the race for president, is yet to announce how much he raised throughout the last quarter."
fe89bceb-8943-4c23-9a9a-a644afc68244,"Hollywood Celebrities Ariana Grande, Mark Ruffalo, Billy Porter Support Soros-Backed Initiative Spreading 'Book Bans' Hoax","Hollywood celebrities including Ariana Grande, Judd Apatow, and Chelsea Handler are lending their support to a George Soros-backed initiative that is trying to re-frame the removal of sexually explicit and other inappropriate books from school libraries as “book bans” — a now ubiquitous semantic hoax that the left is deploying to smear conservatives.
Other stars joining the effort include familiar left-wing Hollywood voices Rob Reiner, Mark Ruffalo, Billy Porter, Ellen Barkin, Patton Oswalt, John Leguizamo, and Piper Perabo.
Oscar-winning filmmaker Guillermo del Toro also added his name to the list of Hollywood supporters.
The “Banned Bookmobile” is going on a multi-state tour to “sound alarms” about so-called book banning, with stops including the key battleground states of Wisconsin, Georgia, and Pennsylvania. The project is backed by MoveOn, the far-left political organization that has received millions of dollars in funding from George Soros.
Star Trek actor LeVar Burton — who was the host of PBS’ Reading Rainbow — is also a major organizer of the “Banned Bookmobile.”
Read the letter and find the full list of signers here:https://t.co/OYpcn0ZJ1y — MoveOn (@MoveOn) September 19, 2023
The semantic deception at the heart of the project is the left’s claim that conservative politicians including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) are engaging in “book bans” and “censorship” when they call for the removal of certain books from public school libraries.
But the targeted books are frequently sexual and sometimes pornographic in nature, like Gender Queer, which teaches about masturbation and oral sex. During a recent Senate hearing on the matter, Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) read passages from All Boys Aren’t Blue and Gender Queer.
“I put some lube on, and I got him on his knees,” Kennedy quoted. “And I began to slide into him from behind.”
Other books in question promote critical race theory — the belief that skin color is the most important aspect of a person’s identity and should be the organizing principle in American society.
Gov. DeSantis has repeatedly defended Florida’s decision to remove certain inappropriate books from school libraries.
“Exposing the ‘book ban’ hoax is important because it reveals that some are attempting to use our schools for indoctrination,” he said in a statement back in March.
“In Florida, pornographic and inappropriate materials that have been snuck into our classrooms and libraries to sexualize our students violate our state education standards. Florida is the education state and that means providing students with a quality education free from sexualization and harmful materials that are not age appropriate.”
The removal of books deemed inappropriate has been going on for decades — often with Democrats leading the charge. Democrats have tried to get Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird and Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn yanked from school library shelves in numerous counties, claiming the classic novels are racist, when in fact they are the opposite of that.
The “Banned Bookmobile” is also serving as a fundraiser for MoveOn, with Mark Ruffalo urging his fans to give money to the left-wing political group.
Artists Against Book Bans is an open letter that calls for an end to book bans & censorship that stifle the vibrant exchange of ideas. Ready to take a stand?

Bodycam footage appears to show the deputy shoot at her Pomeranian when it ran toward him.
The deputy hit the woman instead, she says. She is suing the Columbia County Sheriff's Office.

A woman in Arkansas is suing her local sheriff's office, saying a deputy who fired his gun to shoot at a Pomeranian running toward him hit her instead.
Tina Hight, a resident of Columbia County, called the Columbia County Sheriff's Office on August 30, 2022, asking for assistance for what she told Insider was a ""domestic violence"" incident. The request for help spurred a traumatizing turn of events that still affects her today, she said.
The lawsuit was first reported by local station KATV.
""I became the person who called the cops for my protection to the victim in just a matter of minutes,"" Hight told Insider. ""I'm shaking now just talking about it. It just gave me a lot of anxiety. I'm still very nervous about the police.""
In bodycam footage viewed by Insider, Columbia County Deputy Brian Williams, one of two responding deputies, tells the other officer, ""she's got some dogs in there,"" as they walk up the front yard to knock on her door.
Williams stands back while another deputy in front of him knocks on the door to Hight's residence. When the door opens, a couple of dogs walk out onto the front porch, and Hight explains that they won't bite the deputies.
The dogs — including a Pomeranian mix between 8-10 pounds, per Hight's lawyer — run and bark toward Williams.
Williams then begins shouting, ""Get back! Get your dog! I'll kill this motherfucker!""
The video shows he then fires his gun once into the air. Hight begins gathering her dogs when the Pomeranian escapes and runs toward Williams again. He fires again, hitting Hight, who screams, ""You shot me!""
She begins writhing in pain, telling the deputies to get away from her. ""I'm scared of y'all,"" she says in the video, crying.
Williams and the second deputy deny that he shot Hight. At one point, Williams walks back to the patrol car after being asked to call an ambulance and says the dog was most likely responsible for her injuries.
""I shot at the goddamn dog, and I think the dog scratched her,"" Williams says in the video. ""She said I shot her.""
An ambulance eventually came that night, Tré Kitchens, Hight's lawyer, told Insider.
""I'm telling the officer that I felt the bullet go in,"" Hight told Insider. ""I mean, I felt it was burning. It was like I was on fire. And they just brushed it off.""
Kitchens provided photos to Insider of what he said were Hight's bullet wounds.
Hight said she still has the bullet lodged in her right shin and the pain is ""excruciating."" Hight also said that her Pomeranian was injured by bullet and concrete fragments but has fully recovered.
Kitchens told Insider this was ""one of the most egregious cases"" he had ever seen.
""It was a situation that didn't need to be escalated … it is by the grace of God and luck that he didn't kill another deputy, Ms. Hight, or somebody else in the house,"" Kitchens said.
In the lawsuit filed in June, reviewed by Insider, Hight and her lawyer assert that Williams had ""no basis to discharge his weapon.""
Sheriff Leroy Martin of the Columbia County Sheriff's Office addressed the incident in a statement on Facebook in response to the KATV story, saying the deputy was investigated by the Arkansas State Police and cleared.
""The evidence will come out accurately; and the video will be in it's [sic] entirety and forth coming [sic],"" Martin wrote. ""The video will show that the Deputy was responding to a know [sic] residence as the dog aggressively came at him.""
Hight told Insider that she did not know the deputies before this incident.
Per the lawsuit, Hight is suing for damages, citing medical costs as well as pain and mental anguish she said she suffered due to the incident. Hight is also suing for punitive damages, asking Williams to be disciplined to prevent similar incidents. The lawsuit asks for a monetary award for damages ""exceeding $10,000,000.""
""Not all cops are bad, I'm not saying that,"" Hight told Insider. ""Just be careful, even with law enforcement, whether you're calling them for your protection or not. They do carry a gun, and some will just shoot without thinking about what they're doing. If I ever had to call the law again, I would never open my door, because I'm not going to ever stop owning my animals...I just don't want another life injured or taken over a small dog incident like this.""
An attorney for the sheriff's office did not immediately respond to questions sent by Insider. The Arkansas State Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Insider on Sunday."

Haverhill ""can man"" dies with almost $70,000 in his backpack
HAVERHILL - A beloved member of the Haverhill community has died and he left behind a huge surprise that his friend discovered.
Dennis Babbitt was a quiet man who collected cans for a little bit of change, spending his spare time at the local American Legion, escaping from the elements in which he spent his life.
""He was a wanderer, he lived in the woods,"" said the Legion's lounge manager and Babbitt's friend, Anne Decosta. She said Babbitt was eventually offered a permanent place to stay at at the Legion.
""Rather than have him live in the freezing cold, they let him move in downstairs and kind of be like the night watchman. If there was something wrong downstairs he would let us know,"" said Decosta.
DeCosta said Babbitt lived a simple life, known for riding his bike around town, carrying cans and exchanging them for the little money he had.
""He would collect cans and use his deposits as his survival money,"" said DeCosta, or so she thought.
A short time before he died, Babbitt took a fall, landing him in the hospital. When DeCosta went to visit, he asked her to take care of something on his behalf - find his backpack and put it in a safe. Later, Babbitt died from cardiac arrest. In hopes of returning Babbit's belongings to his family, Decosta opened the bag.
""I opened up the backpack to see what was in it because, obviously, he was concerned about it. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would find $69,450 in it. He had rolls of $100 bills in deli bags, wrapped up with three elastics,"" said DeCosta, who called the police immediately.
""It took three officers and myself to double count, wrap it, sign it and turn it over. I don't know what his intentions were with that money other than living to 120,"" said DeCosta.
WBZ TV did speak to Babbitt's family members, who did not want to go on camera, but said Babbitt's life wasn't easy. He struggled with mental health issues and family troubles as a young child but did his best to survive.
The financial discovery brought relief and smiles to the faces of friends who knew him the most.
""It's going to be different around here, definitely different,"" said Decosta.
The money is now in the possession of the Haverhill Police Department.
The American Legion is hosted a memorial for Babbitt to remember a man they said was a major part of the community."
7be7f5ed-6d0d-449d-9155-264945f4b553,Jets are 'ready to fracture',"The Jets are on the verge of losing one of their biggest supporters.
ESPN host Mike Greenberg, an unabashed Jets fan who experienced the highest of highs this year with the Jets trading for Aaron Rodgers, appears to have found a new low.
With Rodgers sidelined by a torn Achilles tendon, the Jets are relying on Zach Wilson to hold together the team.
But Wilson is crumbling under that pressure, bottoming out Sunday in the 15-10 loss to the Patriots.
Monday on “Get Up,” Greenberg cried uncle with respect to Wilson.
“He cannot be out on the field ever again for the Jets. … Their chances of winning anything this year are over. They’re not remote. They’re done,” Greenberg ranted. “They need to try to keep this thing together and if they run Zach Wilson out there one more time, Garrett Wilson’s going to lose it, Michael Carter was losing it. They’re all going to lose it.
ESPN host Mike Greenberg isn’t happy with Jets quarterback Zach Wilson. Mike Greenberg/X
“I don’t care who it is. Literally anyone. Carson Wentz is calling. Matt Ryan is calling. I don’t care who the hell you have to run out there. Do anything else. But that is going to explode in there. … They can’t put him back on the field again. Sunday night against Kansas City? That team is ready to fracture.”
Garrett Wilson and Michael Carter were each spotted on the sideline Sunday at MetLife Stadium airing their grievances as the Jets offense failed to establish any sort of momentum, aside from the one touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter.
The game was effectively over with 2:19 left in regulation when Zach Wilson was sacked in the end zone for a safety.
He finished the game 18-of-36 for 157 yards and QB rating of 61.9.
Jets quarterback Zach Wilson was sacked three times Sunday. AP
Wilson lost his second straight start since replacing Aaron Rodgers at quarterback. AP
Wilson has completed just 52.4 percent of his passes this season. AP
Through three games this season, Wilson is completing 52.4 percent of his passes and has four interceptions while being sacked eight times.
Greenberg’s Sunday night reference regards the Jets’ Week 4 game, when Kansas City (and maybe Taylor Swift) visit MetLife Stadium.
NBC had hoped it would have the marquee matchup of Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes.
Instead it is stuck with Mahomes and Zach Wilson, which probably means a lot of talk about Swift and her relationship with Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce."

Baldwin, a 41-year-old mom of three, was last seen by her daughter on Nov. 2, when police said she left her home without her purse, wallet, car and Apple Watch, and never returned.
Her missing person case took a peculiar turn in December, when police investigated her husband, Brett Baldwin, and allegedly found 31 images of child sex abuse on his phone seized during the investigation.

d892b9d5-9f0d-4bb9-9334-47350d38cc58,"With a new coach and a parade of new faces, Cincinnati will try to step up in the Big 12","CINCINNATI (AP) — Talk about a season of change.
The Bearcats step up from the American Athletic Conference to the Big 12 with a new coach, new coordinators, new quarterback and a parade of other new players plucked out of the transfer portal.
“It’s an exciting time,” said first-year coach Scott Satterfield, who brought coaches and transfers with him from Louisville. “We’ve got a great seat at a Power Five table now, in a great conference. It’s a lot of excitement throughout our city, the university. You know, the buzz on campus.”
Satterfield has a monumental job at Cincinnati.
The only returning starter on offense is center Gavin Gerhardt. Last year’s starting quarterback, Ben Bryant, transferred to Northwestern. Bryant’s backup, Evan Prater, had some shoulder trouble and switched to wide receiver.
There are so many unknowns for the Bearcats that the Big 12 media picked them to finish 13th out of 14 teams, just above West Virginia and below other new members Brigham Young (6), Central Florida (8) and Houston (12).
“We’ve got to have a sense of urgency every day,” Satterfield said. “Meetings, practices, walk-throughs — a sense of urgency every single day. You don’t want to get to the game and say, ‘now it’s too late.’ You know, we’ve got have it now.”
The Bearcats finished 9-4 in their final year in the American Athletic Conference in 2022, including 6-2 in conference.
DEFENSIVE STRENGTH
One thing Satterfield knows is that Cincinnati’s defensive line will be one of its strengths. Second-year interior lineman Dontay Corleone — whose nickname, of course, is “The Godfather” — is on the watch list for the Bednarik Award, given to the best defensive player in college football.
Returning DL veterans Malik Vann and Jowon Briggs are also outstanding, having combined for 19 career sacks.
“They’re some dudes,” new defensive coordinator Bryan Brown said after the Bearcats’ first scrimmage. “I think they can be the best in the Big 12, or even the country.”
A combination of returning starters and transfers will fill out the back end of the unit.
MEET THE NEW BOSS
The 50-year-old Satterfield made his name as the head man at Appalachia State in his native North Carolina, compiling a 46-16 record and leading the Mountaineers to three bowl games in five seasons. He was hired at Louisville in 2019 and was less successful, going 25-24 in four seasons and putting himself on the hot seat with a 7-5 finish in 2022. Satterfield was hired by Cincinnati in December to replace Luke Fickell, who moved on to lead Wisconsin.
AND THE NEW WEAPONS
The presumptive starter at quarterback is Emory Jones, a grad transfer who will be in his sixth season and third school after playing at Florida and Arizona State. The dual-threat QB had his best year in 2021 as the Gators’ starter, throwing for 2,734 yards and 19 touchdowns.
Look for the shifty Jones to also spark the Bearcats’ ground game, which struggled last season.
UC’s top six receivers from 2022 left for the NFL or jumped in the transfer portal. Transfers Dee Wiggins (Louisville), Donovan Ollie (Washington State), Xzavier Henderson (Florida) and Aaron Turner (UConn) are the prospective top targets.
BIG RESPONSIBILITY
Gerhardt knows he’s got to assume a leadership role on the reconstituted O-line. Three of the four starters are expected to be transfers, including guard Luke Kandra, a Cincinnati native who followed Satterfield from Louisville.
“I consider myself pretty smart and someone who leads by example, but being as vocal as I can will help this team,” Gerhardt said. “Last fall camp I was the young guy moving from guard to starting center, but this year is a bit different.”
SCHEDULE
The Bearcats open the season at home against Eastern Kentucky on Sept. 2. Key games are Oklahoma at home (Sept. 23), home against Baylor (Oct. 21) and at Oklahoma State (Oct. 28).

ec3042a9-7081-4964-9cff-5f7c03e2dd24,South Korea's Hyundai to invest $2.45 bln in Indian state,"CHENNAI, May 11 (Reuters) - South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) said on Thursday it will invest 200 billion rupees ($2.45 billion) in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu over the next 10 years, to beef up electric vehicle production in the world's most populous country.
Tamil Nadu is a hub for automobile manufacturing with the likes of Ashok Leyland (ASOK.NS), TVS Motor (TVSM.NS), Hyundai and Renault-Nissan making thousands of two- and four-wheelers every year.
Hyundai, through its Indian subsidiary Hyundai Motor India, will also set up a battery pack assembly unit with an annual capacity of 178,000 units and install 100 EV charging stations across the state in the next five years, it said in a statement.
The carmaker's move comes a few weeks after the federal government said it would raise taxes on imported cars and motorbikes, including electric vehicles (EVs), as it seeks to boost local manufacturing.
India's EV industry has grown rapidly, with domestic carmakers Tata Motors (TAMO.NS) and Mahindra & Mahindra (MAHM.NS) as well as global rivals BYD (002594.SZ) and SAIC's (600104.SS) MG Motor lining up launches.
However, the market is still small, accounting for roughly 1% of the total car sales in the country in 2022. The federal government aims to push that number to 30% by 2030 as it looks to reduce pollution and fuel imports.
As of April, Hyundai had a nearly 15% market share in India's passenger vehicle space, only behind Maruti Suzuki.
Hyundai rivals Nissan Motor (7201.T) and Renault SA (RENA.PA) in February said they would invest $600 million to fund the development of two electric models and four sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) for sale in India and abroad.

[Note: Guess GES ’ FY’23 ended on Jan 28, 2023]
Guess Stock (NYSE: GES), a retailer that designs, markets, distributes, and licenses apparel and accessories for men, women, and children, grew roughly 4% year-to-date – rising from about $20 to around $21 currently, underperforming the S&P500, which grew about 13%. Guess is cheap relative to its historical performance, which currently reflects the near-term outlook. However, we expect the stock to perform well in the long term. As a general protective move to shore up inventory, the retailer ordered products earlier than normal to deal with supply chain headwinds. The strategy seems to have worked in FY2023 (year ended Jan 2023), as the company has been able to deliver more products to wholesalers due to its accurate acquisition of enough products. Still, the foreign currency fluctuations are definitely a drag on the company and we expect the FX headwinds to continue in FY 2024 as well.
GES stock has seen a decline of 20% from levels of $25 in early January 2021 to around current levels, vs. an increase of about 15% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 3-year period. However, the decrease in GES stock has been far from consistent. Returns for the stock were 5% in 2021, -13% in 2022, and 4% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 13% in 2023 - indicating an underperformance for the ticker in 2021 and 2023. In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 - in good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Consumer Discretionary sector including AMZN, TSLA, and TM, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could GES face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2023 and lose value over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery?
Guess’ sales increased a modest 3% year-over-year (y-o-y) to around $665 million. American retail sales were down 11%, while wholesale sales was down 20% y-o-y in Q2, likely due to softening demand relative to the prior period. To counter the weak sales trends, management limited its promotions and discounts that could have harmed the margins. However, it should be noted that the standout performances in Asia and Europe offset these declines. The biggest achievement in the quarter was the company’s profitability. Its operating margin improved to 9.7% in Q2 2024 from 8.3% in Q2 2023, which resulted in the retailer’s adjusted earnings growing a large 85% y-o-y to 72 cents in Q2 2024. That said, the company’s Americas region accounts for almost 35% of the total revenues and any further weakening in this region could be a warning sign in the upcoming holiday season.
We forecast Guess Revenues to be $2.8 billion for the fiscal year 2024, up 3% y-o-y. Looking at the bottom line, we now forecast earnings per share to come in at $2.95. Given our revenues and EPS forecast changes, we have revised Guess Valuation to $23 per share, based on a $2.95 expected EPS and a 7.8x P/E multiple for the fiscal year 2024. That said, the company’s stock appears appropriately priced at the current levels, with our valuation at only a 7% premium from the current market price. For fiscal 2024, management narrowed its revenue guidance. The company previously expected a 2.5% to 4.5% growth whereas it now expects 2.5% to 4% growth. However, it raised its guidance for its operating margin from 7.5%-8.3% to 8.9%-9.3%, which is meaningful.

cf2891c2-8181-49d7-86b5-80f4cef0b87a,SCOTT HODGE: It’s Time To Switch From A Neiman Marcus Tax Code To A Walmart One,"Tax Day, April 15, is always a good day to reflect on the things we value. For example, what do you value more than money? Family? Faith? Country? How about time? After all, even for the fittest Americans, time on Earth is limited.
If our time is so precious, shouldn’t we do something about the federal tax code that costs Americans upwards of 6.5 billion hours to comply with and over $300 billion per year in lost productivity?
That’s time and money we will never see again.
Americans say they’ve had enough. They are telling pollsters that they think the tax code is too complicated and in need of reform. A new national survey released by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation found that 65 percent of U.S. taxpayers think the tax code is overly complex and even more of us—86 percent—think the federal tax code needs an overhaul.
I’m often asked, why is the tax code so complicated? To start with, there are roughly 220 tax deductions and credits in the code and nearly every one of those provisions was put there to incentivize us to conform to political priorities, not our own.
Simplifying the tax code would give us back our time and our ability to make our own choices about how we want to spend, save, or invest our own money.
A simpler tax code would also mean a smaller, less intrusive Internal Revenue Service. Over the decades, politicians have turned the IRS into a superagency, managing programs aimed at promoting housing, electric vehicles, health care, education, corporate welfare, and social services, just to name a few. Managing programs is not a skill set for a tax-collection agency.
Despite their desire for tax reform, many taxpayers fear giving up the credits and deductions they know for the prospects of a simpler tax code. But as I outline in my new book, Taxocracy: What You Don’t Know About Taxes and How They Rule Your Daily Life, many of the most popular credits and deductions don’t meet their stated goal or have serious unintended consequences.
In fact, tax subsidies can often make things less affordable rather than more affordable. For example, studies find the mortgage interest deduction gets capitalized into the price of homes, making homeownership less attainable. One study found the deduction “has no discernable impact on U.S. homeownership outcomes.”
The same goes for the tax credits for higher education costs. Universities often just pocket the amount of the credit by raising tuition prices or offer less financial aid, knowing the IRS is absorbing the cost. One academic study found that the American Opportunity Tax Credit, implemented during the Obama era, “generated very little change in college attendance or other college-related outcomes.”
Lawmakers’ efforts as venture capitalists have also been a failure. The dozens of tax subsidies for clean energy and electric vehicles in the Inflation Reduction Act have turned corporate tax departments into profit centers chasing tax breaks. Despite the advertising, purchasers of EVs don’t fully benefit from EV tax credits because automakers soak up the tax subsidies with higher prices in the same manner that universities soak up tuition tax credits with higher tuition costs.
See a pattern here?
Our current tax code is like shopping at Neiman Marcus during a 10-percent-off sale for select items. The discount gives us a false sense of savings, but we are really not getting a bargain. We should ditch the illusion of discounts and move toward a Walmart tax code with low taxes every day.

180bb862-268e-414b-89e1-d677d0a634c2,Good Samaritan's face slashed on subway after intervening in fight,"When Gideon Moncrieffe looks in the mirror, he’ll always be reminded of the price he paid for being a Good Samaritan.
An eight-inch long gash runs from the top of his head to the bottom of his left cheek, the work of an unhinged ex-con who viciously attacked him after he tried to defuse a violent altercation last month on a Brooklyn train — an intervention fueled by the chokehold death of Jordan Neely 10 days earlier.
“When I saw that all I thought about was Jordan Neely and I thought I just didn’t want this to escalate,” he told The Post.
“I didn’t want someone else to get killed or hurt.”
The mayhem unfolded May 10 on the southbound C train in Brooklyn where Moncrieffe, 44, the global head of event production at TikTok, sat on his way back home to Stuyvesant Heights after grabbing dinner with a friend and noticed Sean Lewis, 33, squabbling with an older drunk man, who fell to the floor during the spat, although Moncrieffe said he didn’t know if the man was pushed or toppled over when the train lurched.
Lewis was arrested on May 18 and charged with multiple counts of felony assault. DCPI
Moncrieffe said he asked whether Lewis was OK, hoping to prevent the situation from escalating, but Lewis responded by shoving him.
“I said look, somebody was killed on the train two weeks ago, they were choked out because someone proceeded to be aggressive,” Moncrieffe said, referring to ex-con Neely, who witnesses said was menacing other straphangers before ex-Marine Daniel Penny placed him in a fatal chokehold aboard an F train in Manhattan.
Moncrieffe said the older man left the train at some point while he spoke to Lewis.
“I said I don’t know you, but I love and respect you,” Moncrieffe said he told Lewis.
“You’re a young black man. You look like me. I just want to make sure you get home safe.”
But Lewis offered a bone-chilling response, according to Moncrieffe.
“He then said to me, ‘Yeah you don’t know me, but I’m going to make sure you remember me,'” Moncrieffe said.
With that, Moncrieffe retreated to the further end of the car with his back to the door — then felt a tap on his shoulder when the train doors opened behind him at the Fulton Street station.
Moncrieffe turned around to find Lewis standing there.
“He says ‘Thank you,’… and as he says ‘Thank you’ he slashes me down my face,” Moncrieffe said.
Moncrieffe could no longer see out of his left eye as the blood poured from his face, never saw the weapon.
He began screaming at passengers to stay on the train, fearing that Lewis would attack someone else on the platform.
Moncrieffe said he had been heading home on the subway after meeting a friend for dinner when he was attacked by Lewis. Linkedin gideonemoncrieffe
Eventually, he made his way up the platform to the front of the train, where passengers helped him up the stairs and police took him to Kings County Hospital.
Lewis was arrested eight days later after police released surveillance footage from the station.
Moncrieffe learned his alleged attacker had recently been released from jail without bail by Judge Dale Fong-Fredrick — four days after he had been arrested and charged with strangulation, assault, harassment, and other counts stemming from an arrest on April 10th, after he allegedly choked his girlfriend and threatened her with a knife.
Lewis had been previously been arrested for shoving his girlfriend into a window in January and was also cuffed for misdemeanor assault after attacking an employee at a homeless shelter in August 2022, but he took a plea deal and was convicted of disorderly conduct in November, according to a law enforcement source.

Lewis has been arrested a total of nine times since 2016 for crimes including fare evasion in February 2016, robbery in July 2021, and most recently assault and strangulation this year.
Moncrieffe, who needed about 100 stitches after the attack, said he broke down while testifying before a grand jury on May 26, where he saw the photos of his injuries for the first time as they were presented to jurors, who decided to indict Lewis on multiple counts of felony assault, including assault with a weapon and assault with intent to disfigure.
“That’s the first time I saw how deep the cut was and how big my face was, so I just broke down on the stand,” he said.
Brooklyn District Attorney’s requested to have Lewis held on $50,000 cash bail or $100,000 bond, but Judge Patrick Hayes Lewis instead set bail at just $7,500.
Moncrieffe considers the amount far too low.
“If someone does step forward and bail him out for just $7,500, I think that’s just ridiculous,” Moncrieffe said.
“His crimes have only gotten worse.”
Moncrieffe said the deep cut to his face, which severed some of his facial muscles, means he now can’t smile, laugh, or cry without pain.
He doesn’t see himself ever taking the New York City subway again.
“I won’t feel comfortable and will have extreme anxiety going on the train. It’s just not safe,” he said.
He continued: “It sucks and at the end of the day we deserve to get to and fro without someone attacking us just because.”
A GoFundMe has since been started for Moncrieffe’s medical costs with a goal of $100,000, which has since raised over $70,000."

SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) — Tropical Storm Franklin made landfall Wednesday on the island of Hispaniola shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti, bringing fears it would trigger deadly landslides and heavy flooding in both countries.
Franklin was expected to swirl above the island for most of the day, with forecasters warning the storm could dump up to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain, with a maximum of 15 inches (38 centimeters) for the central region of Hispaniola.
On Wednesday morning, the storm was centered about 105 miles (170 kilometers) west-southwest of Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. It had maximum winds of 50 mph (85 kph) with higher gusts and was moving northward at 10 mph (17 kph). It made landfall along the country’s southern coast near Bahahona.
Emergency operations officials said they were looking for a 54-year-old man with mental health problems who went missing after he jumped into a creek late Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Harold weakened into a tropical depression Tuesday night after making landfall in South Texas, bringing strong winds, rain and leaving thousands of homes without power.
In the Caribbean, officials were most concerned about Franklin’s impact in Haiti, which is vulnerable to catastrophic flooding given the country’s severe erosion.
Prime Minister Ariel Henry had urged Haitians on Tuesday to stock up on water, food and medication as authorities checked on some of the more than 200,000 people displaced by gang violence, with some living on the street or in makeshift shelters.
Some recalled how a powerful thunderstorm that unleashed heavy rains one day in June left more than 40 people dead across Haiti.
In the Dominican Republic, officials shuttered schools, government agencies and several airports with at least 24 of the country’s 31 provinces under red alert. By early Wednesday, more than 40 aqueducts were out of service because of heavy rains, affecting more than 830,000 customers.
Flooding already had been reported on Tuesday in Santo Domingo and beyond, where residents prepared for heavy rainfall as authorities evacuated 31 families.
“We’re scared of the river,” said Doralisa Sánchez, a government employee who lives near the Ozama River that divides the capital and has had to flee her home three times during previous storms.
She hoped Franklin wouldn’t force her to seek shelter and temporarily abandon her home because she said people steal belongings left behind.
Others, like businesswoman Albita Achangel, worried they had nowhere to go if the waters start rising.
“We are hoping for God’s will,” she said, adding that her patio already was flooded.
The storm worried thousands of Dominicans who live in flood-prone areas.
“When two drops of water fall here, this suddenly becomes flooded,” said Juan Olivo Urbáez, who owns a small business in a community near the Ozama River.
A tropical storm warning was in effect for the entire southern coast of the Dominican Republic and Haiti, as well as the entire northern Dominican coast. The government of the Bahamas also issued a tropical storm warning for the Turks and Caicos Islands, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
Franklin is the seventh named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. An eighth named storm, Gert, dissipated on Tuesday.
On Aug. 10, the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration updated its forecast and warned that this year’s hurricane season would be above normal. Between 14 to 21 named storms are forecast. Of those, six to 11 could become hurricanes, with two to five of them possibly becoming major hurricanes."

Johnny Sexton will play his first game since March after being named in Ireland's team for Saturday's World Cup opener against Romania in Bordeaux.
Skipper Sexton, 38, is in a team which has 10 starters from the Grand Slam clinching win over England in March.
That was the veteran fly-half's last competitive game when a groin injury led to his second-half substitution.
Sexton missed Ireland's three World Cup warm-up games last month as he was serving a three-match suspension.
The ban was imposed after Sexton was found to have been ""confrontational and aggressive"" towards match referee Jaco Peyper following Leinster's dramatic Heineken Champions Cup final defeat by La Rochelle in May - a game the fly-half had been forced to miss because of his injury.
Despite having no game time in nearly six months, Sexton, whose playing career will end at the conclusion of his fourth World Cup campaign, insisted that he ""expects to produce a good performance"" on Saturday.
""There are no excuses in that regard,"" said the 113-times capped fly-half.
""Once I got over the injury, then came the three games off, and once I knew that was there, I've just been focused on this game for the last couple of months.""
Ireland team to face Romania: Keenan; Earls, Ringrose, Aki, Lowe; Sexton (capt), Gibson-Park; Porter, Herring, Furlong; McCarthy, Ryan; Beirne, O'Mahony, Doris.
Replacements: Kelleher, Loughman, O'Toole, Henderson, Van der Flier, Murray, Crowley, Henshaw.
Coach Andy Farrell's backs changes from the win over England six months ago see Keith Earls and fit-again Garry Ringrose taking over from Mack Hansen and Robbie Henshaw, while Munster's Jack Crowley is preferred to Ross Byrne as the bench back-up option for Sexton.
In the pack, Rob Herring is named at hooker, with regular starter Dan Sheehan not deemed ready to play in Saturday's opener following the foot injury he sustained in the warm-up win over England.
The other forward changes from the Grand Slam game see Joe McCarthy taking over from Ryan Baird in the second row, with Tadhg Beirne, whose recent Ireland appearances have been at lock, named in the back row as Josh van der Flier is included in the replacements.
Herring is given the number three jersey ahead of Ronan Kelleher, who also has had fitness issues in recent weeks.
Leinster lock Joe McCarthy will earn only his fourth Ireland cap when he starts in Saturday's World Cup opener against Romania
McCarthy's selection will surprise some but Farrell insisted that the Leinster lock merited his inclusion and scoffed at any suggestion that he had opted for a ""mix and match"" side rather than picking his strongest available team.
""He (McCarthy) deserves it with the form that he's shown not just in the games that he's played but also in his preparation over the last 10, 11 weeks. He's really progressed his game,"" added the Ireland coach.
""There's no mix and match now. We've got a squad of 33 that we totally believe in and whatever side we put out is going to be a good side.
""That side is going to be the one that represents the group so not matter what side we put out at this stage, it's going to be one that's threatening and a determined one at that.""
Farrell said Crowley's versatility had come into his thought process when deciding on the replacement fly-half berth.
""Jack has been playing well, travelling well….so has Ross. You've got to make a decision.""
Ireland on 13-game winning run
Ireland go into the World Cup on the back of a 13-Test winning run stretching back to last summer's series victory over the All Blacks.
Since that triumph in New Zealand, Farrell's side have underlined their status as the world's number one team by beating South Africa - who they will face in Pool B - and Australia in the autumn Tests before clinching the Grand Slam in this year's Six Nations.
However, the Irish have failed to go beyond the quarter-finals stage at all previous nine World Cups despite having gone into several tournaments as one of the form teams.
Farrell's side will be expected to comfortably overcome the 19th-ranked Romanians at the Stade de Bordeaux.
Romania have never reached the knockout stages of the World Cup in eight previous attempts, while they have lost all nine meetings with Ireland, three of which came at the 1999, 2003 and 2015 tournaments.

After the Devils took a 1-0 lead 38 seconds into the third period, the Golden Knights scored the next two goals.
Maneuvering his way through the neutral zone and finding open ice at the top of the slot, Eichel finally beat New Jersey goalie Jake Allen with his seventh shot of the game to the delight of an announced sold-out crowd of 18,234.
William Carrier and William Karlsson also scored for Vegas, while goalie Logan Thompson stopped 19 shots. Defenseman Noah Hanifin had two assists.
Nico Hischier scored for New Jersey, which played on the second leg of back-to-back nights and its fourth road game in seven days. Allen made 34 saves.
Dawson Mercer appeared to open the scoring early for the Devils, tapping in a rebound, but the goal was overturned when it was ruled Timo Meier interfered with Thompson.
From there it turned into a shooting gallery for the Golden Knights, who went on to outshoot the Devils 24-15 through the 19:22 mark of the third period.
That was when Hischier took advantage of an errant rebound moments into the final stanza after the initial shot trickled past Thompson and Hanifin batted the puck into the slot.
But the Golden Knights weren't too deflated, as Alex Pietrangelo took a cross-ice pass from Hanifin, and ripped a wrister from the top of the left circle, which deflected off Carrier's shoulder to tie the game moments after Hischier's goal.
Karlsson's empty-net goal with 20 seconds remaining provided the final margin.
Golden Knights Ivan Barbashev and Ben Hutton both played in their 500th career game.

2329e428-52e9-480b-8725-4994659b0807,Manhattan DA Bragg requests judge impose gag order on Trump during hush money case,"Join Fox News for access to this content Plus special access to select articles and other premium content with your account - free of charge. Please enter a valid email address.
Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has requested a judge impose a gag order on former President Donald Trump with less than a month to go until the hush money criminal court case goes to trial.
In three separate court filings dated Feb. 22, 2024, Bragg and his team asked for an order preventing Trump from making statements attacking others involved in his legal cases, sought a protective order to prohibit the names and addresses of jurors from being disclosed to anyone other than attorneys and requested evidence and testimony regarding campaign finance be limited.
Prosecutors claim Trump has a history of verbally attacking people involved in his cases.
""Defendant has a long history of making public and inflammatory remarks about the participants in various judicial proceedings against him, including jurors, witnesses, lawyers, and court staff,"" prosecutors state. ""Those remarks, as well as the inevitable reactions they incite from defendant’s followers and allies, pose a significant and imminent threat to the orderly administration of this criminal proceeding and a substantial likelihood of causing material prejudice.""
COURT DATES AND PRIMARIES: TRUMP FACES COMPETING CALENDARS IN 2024
Jury selection for the criminal trial is scheduled to begin on March 25.
The DA’s office requested the names and addresses of those jurors who are selected not to be disclosed to anyone other than counsel, citing the former president’s conduct toward jurors in other court proceedings.
The DA’s office cites Trump’s ""conduct in this and other matters – including his extensive history of attacking jurors in other proceedings,"" saying the conduct presents a ""significant risk of juror harassment and intimidation that warrants reasonable protective measures to ensure the integrity of these proceedings, minimize obstacles to jury selection, and protect juror safety.""
TRUMP SLAMS BRAGG AFTER PLEADING NOT GUILTY: 'I NEVER THOUGHT ANYTHING LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN IN AMERICA'
In the filing, Bragg provided several examples of times when Trump made public statements directed at two different Fulton County grand juries.
""Thank you to the Special Grand Jury in the Great State of Georgia for your Patriotism & Courage. Total exoneration. The USA is very proud of you,"" Trump said in one instance. ""Would someone please tell the Fulton County Grand Jury that I did not tamper with the election,"" he said in another.
The DA said in March 2023, Trump ""repeatedly directed extrajudicial statements"" toward members of the grand jury using social media and commented on the credibility of witnesses who testified before the grand jury, as the grand jury investigation was underway.
TRUMP PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO 34 FELONY COUNTS OF FALSIFYING BUSINESS RECORDS LINKED TO 2016 HUSH MONEY PAYMENTS
One other example brought up by the DA in the filing was that Trump ""frequently promises to seek revenge and retribution against his perceived opponents.""
Specifically, the DA pointed to a book published in 2007, in which Trump wrote, ""My motto is: Always get even. When somebody screws you, screw them back in spades.""
The third motion filed looked to limit evidence and expert testimony that could be presented during the hush money trial, including campaign finance, ""federal prosecutors’ purported views of Michael Cohen’s credibility,"" and evidence that had already been rejected.
Judge Juan Manuel Merchan did not immediately rule on the filings, according to The Associated Press.
Bragg’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.
""Today, the 2-tiered system of justice implemented against President Trump is on full display, with the request by another Deranged Democrat prosecutor seeking a restrictive gag order, which if granted, would impose an unconstitutional infringement on President Trump's First Amendment rights, including his ability to defend himself, and the rights of all Americans to hear from President Trump,"" Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said. ""This is election interference pure and simple. This case, like the others, is a sham orchestrated by partisan Democrats desperately attempting to prevent the reelection of President Trump and distract from the decrepit presidency of Crooked Joe Biden. The Radical Left will fail, and President Trump will Make America Great Again.""
Trump is already subject to a gag order in another federal case, in which Washington, D.C. charges him with scheming to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.

The order was imposed in October by the judge overseeing the case, and then upheld by a federal appeals panel two months later. Still, the court drew in the initial speech restrictions and will allow Trump to criticize the special counsel who brought the case against him.
Trump was also under a limited gag order during his New York civil fraud trial and fined $15,000 for violating the order twice. The gag order was imposed by Judge Arthur Engoron on Oct. 3 after the former president posted on social media about his chief law clerk.

1d02552d-8083-461c-9cd8-4ed78cb2a2ff,Meet the 100-year-old company behind the signature smell of baked bread in Malden,"Malden's Piantedosi Bread Company has provided signature products, and smell, for decades
Malden's Piantedosi Bread Company has provided signature products, and smell, for decades
Malden's Piantedosi Bread Company has provided signature products, and smell, for decades
MALDEN – If you've been to Malden you might smell a strong scent of fresh baked bread, and it's not your imagination. You can thank Piantedosi Bread Company for that.
""Who doesn't like the smell of fresh baked bread? It's comfort food. It warms the heart and the soul,"" Joseph Piantedosi Jr., executive vice president of Piantedosi said.
The company is an 108-year old family-owned and operated business. They've been making Malden smell like bread since they moved their factory there in 1975.
""Between our company and New England coffee it's been a standing joke for years that depending on the way the wind blows you smell bread or coffee,"" Piantedosi said.
Joe is the third generation to run the business. His grandfather came to Massachusetts from Italy in 1916 and started a bread route.
He would buy and deliver fresh bread from the North End to people in Everett in a horse and wagon. It was his grandmother's idea to eventually make the bread themselves.
His grandfather didn't know anything about baking bread but opened a garage bakery and made deliveries while his grandmother tended to the shop.
""He was nicknamed the midnight baker because he delivered up until midnight, house to house. It's amazing. I enjoy it. Sometimes I have to pinch myself and realize what my grandfather with humble beginnings created,"" Piantedosi said.
Joe was very close with his grandfather growing up and loved the family bread business. His grandfather always wanted him to be a part of running the company one day. He's happy that the Malden community has embraced the company so much.
""It's nice to be a part of this community for sure,"" he said.
Now they're one of the largest bread baking companies in New England. Their products can be found in grocery stores and even shipping around the country.
Joe says his grandfather would be proud of what they've achieved.
""Giving people bread, it makes them feel so good. There's something about the scent of bread, tasting bread, and bread has been an important part of culture of this world,"" he said.
He's gotten used to the smell at this point. But Joe told WBZ-TV that when he's been away for a while on a trip and comes back, he can always tell when he's getting close to home.
""As soon as I pull into the city, I'm like 'I'm back home in Malden.' There's no question,"" he said.
Now the fourth generation is involved in the family business, and they've expanded to start selling their frozen products internationally."

A Cleveland native is at the helm of what promises to be one of this summer's blockbusters.
Driving the news: ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" opens this week and is directed by John Marshall High School grad Steven Caple Jr., who left Tremont for USC film school.
Here's a look at the projects that propelled Caple to blockbuster glory:
🌳 ""A Different Tree""
Caple's big break came in 2013 when his student film ""A Different Tree"" won HBO's Short Film competition.
It follows an 8-year-old girl who builds a relationship with her absent father through a school family tree project.
🛹 ""The Land""
Caple's first feature film was shot in Cleveland over three weeks in July 2015.
""The Land,"" which debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in 2016, centers on four teenage boys who hope to use skateboarding to make it out of Cleveland but get caught in the web of a local drug queenpin.
🥊 ""Creed II""
Caple stepped up to the big leagues when he took over the ""Rocky""/""Creed"" franchise from former USC classmate Ryan Coogler (""Black Panther"").
Caple directed Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone in ""Creed 2,"" which grossed more than $214 million worldwide.
🤖 ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts""
Caple directs the seventh entry in a ""Transformers"" film franchise that has grossed nearly $5 billion worldwide.
""Rise of the Beasts"" is expected to earn around $70 million during its opening week in North America, which would be the largest haul yet for a Caple-helmed film.
What's next: Caple will direct and produce ""Byall,"" according to Deadline."
0793bf38-8a5a-44b4-a703-b82d0b926d9d,Cincinnati's Coney Island to Close at End of 2023,"Cincinnati's Coney Island is shutting down.
After over 125 years of business, the amusement park announced Thursday that it will be ""permanently ceasing operations"" as of Dec. 31, 2023.
Coney Island first opened in 1886 with Sunlite Pool opening in 1925, WCPO reported. Dennis Speigel, who started to work there 34 years after the pool opened, said he was shocked by the news.
""I began as a ticket taker at the front gate in 1959. I worked through junior high, high school and college,"" he said. ""Kind of a sad moment for me to see it go, but I understand why.""
Speigel added that there were signs though that the closure was eventually coming.
""I have watched the Coney Island project shrink and diminish over the last few years. We saw the rides go away,"" he said, adding that the closure is a loss for Cincinnati.
""We have been proud to provide a place where so many wonderful memories were created for families,"" the park said in a statement. ""We thank the millions of patrons and employees from Cincinnati and surrounding neighborhoods.""
WCPO noted that the park was acquired by Music & Event Management Inc. (MEMI), which is a subsidiary of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra (CSO).
""Our goal is to elevate Cincinnati's music scene and make it a must-play area for all musicians out on tour,"" MEMI Vice President of Marketing Rosemarie Moehring told the outlet.
The venue will have ""cutting-edge performance and entertainment technology"" alongside ""best-in-class amenities"" as well as an advanced sound system and an adaptable seating arrangement.
The amphitheater is designed to complement Riverbend and PNC Pavilion, neighboring amphitheaters situated directly adjacent to Coney Island.
""The location is good in the sense that it creates a unique one-of-a-kind entertainment complex that I don't believe exists right now in the United States,"" Moehring said, noting that the number of concerts being held at Riverbend will shrink.
""It will stay in existence, but once the new venue is open, and our target date for that right now is spring of 2026, will no longer do concerts on a regular basis at Riverbend. But, we would utilize it in those instances where we were doing festivals.""
Jonathan Martin, president and CEO of CSO, stated that the new venue will ""usher in the future of the music industry,"" adding that he hoped it would help boost the local economy while expanding the music, arts and entertainment industry in the region."

76e63daf-9c5a-4d6e-a785-4fde7304bd5d,Who is Hamas? What to know about the group attacking Israel,"Americans are trying to help family escape Israel following Gaza ""complete siege"" order
The Palestinian militant group Hamas carried out a devastating attack on Israel over the weekend killing hundreds of Israelis, which was praised by the Lebanese group Hezbollah. The assault ignited a war with the Jewish state, leading to the deaths of hundreds of more people in the Gaza Strip in retaliatory strikes.
What is Hamas' ideology?
Hamas is an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, which means Islamic Resistance Movement, according to the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center. The group is ""committed to armed resistance against Israel and the creation of an Islamic Palestinian state in Israel's place,"" according to the center.
What is the Hamas charter?
Hamas' 1988 charter calls for the destruction of Israel, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.
Steven Cook, a senior fellow for Middle East and Africa studies for the council, said in 2021 that Hamas ""sees all of Israel and Palestine as Muslim lands, and thus the illegitimacy of Israel and Jewish claims to those lands.""
Who funds Hamas?
Hamas receives material and financial support from Iran, according to the U.S. government and the Council on Foreign Relations. U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer told CBS News on Monday that Iran was ""broadly complicit"" in the latest conflict, but he also said Iran wasn't known to be directly involved in the attacks.
""What I can say, without a doubt, is that Iran is broadly complicit in these attacks,"" Finer said on ""CBS Mornings."" ""Iran has been Hamas' primary backer for decades. They have provided them weapons, they have provided them training, they have provided them financial support. … What we have not seen yet at this moment, although we are continuing to look at it very closely, is any sort of direct involvement in the immediate attacks that took place over the last couple of days.""
Iran openly admits to supporting Palestinian groups in Gaza; leaders of both Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which also participated in the attack on Israel, regularly visit the country's capital of Tehran. They both visited the city in June, and held extensive meetings with top Iranian officials, including with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
During his meeting with Hamas' politburo chief, Khamenei reiterated ""Iran's continued support for the Palestinian people, their resistance, and their just cause, as it is a legitimate duty from which there is no retreat,"" Hamas said in a statement after the meeting. He also called for ""exerting and consolidating efforts to support the steadfastness of the Palestinian people and end the siege on the Gaza Strip,"" the statement added.
The Palestinian factions don't make their ties with Iran a secret either. They admit Iran has been their primary supporter.
In a televised speech in December 2017, Hamas' top commander in Gaza, Yahya al-Sinwar, bragged that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard general killed by the U.S. in Baghdad in 2020 — Qassem Soleimani — had contacted the leadership of the al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, as well as with the leadership of the al-Quds Brigades, the military wing of Islamic Jihad, and offered them the Guard's full support.
""All our resources and capabilities are at your disposal in the battle to defend Jerusalem,"" al-Sinwar quoted the Iranian general as saying.
Once Iran's foreign operations chief, Soleimani was killed by a U.S. drone strike outside Baghdad Airport in Iraq on Jan. 3, 2020.
Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad recently held military drills in the Gaza Strip, as did Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.

Where is Hamas located?
According to the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center, Hamas primarily operates in Gaza but also has a presence in the West Bank, where the Israeli government and Palestinian Authority control different parts of the Palestinian territory.
Other areas where Hamas operates are the Middle Eastern capitals of Doha, Qatar and Cairo, Egypt, as well as Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, according to the center.
Is Hamas Palestinian?
Yes. The group formed in 1987 as the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist political movement that was founded in Egypt in 1928.
In 2007, Hamas ousted the Palestinian Authority from power in Gaza.
Is Hamas designated a terrorist group?
Yes. Hamas was designated a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department in October 1997 along with several other groups, including Hezbollah.
In the U.S., the designation makes it illegal for Americans to knowingly provide ""material support or resources"" to such groups. U.S. financial institutions must also seize control of a designated organization's funds in their possession and report them to the government.
What is the difference between Hamas and Hezbollah?
Like Hamas, Hezbollah is also an Iran-backed group with a political party and a militant wing that's been designated a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S., which refers to the group as Hizballah. Hezbollah also opposes Israel, and the two sides have fought against each other before.
But Hezbollah is based in south Lebanon, which borders northern Israel. It operates as a militia alongside Lebanon's armed forces, according to the CIA World Factbook.
Hamas and Hezbollah follow different divisions of Islam. Hamas is predominately Sunni, the religion's single biggest group that a majority of several countries follow, including Egypt. Hezbollah is a Shiite group, the religion's second-largest division that Iran's population overwhelmingly follows."
c9a1b78c-ebf3-412a-950a-7c7df1ec8f63,ALAN DERSHOWITZ: The Only Way To Deter Terrorist Attacks On Israel Is To Punish Who’s Responsible - Iran,"There are many losers in Hamas’ war-crime attack against Israeli civilians. Primary among them are the Israeli women, children and other civilians who have been killed, wounded and kidnapped.
They also include Israeli soldiers as well as Palestinian civilians who are forced to serve as human shields to protect Hamas terrorists.
Hamas terrorists have also been killed, but they deserve no sympathy. (RELATED: SHOSHANA BRYEN: Israel Is At War Against Generations Of Hate)
There is one clear winner: Iran.
There can be no doubt about who instigated the attack. Hamas and Hezbollah are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Iranian mullahs, who call the shots.
Iran’s primary goals are obvious: to prevent a deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel and to sow disarray throughout the region. The regime may well succeed.
Another goal is to marginalize the Palestinian Authority and elevate Hamas, thus making a two-state solution impossible — because Hamas will not settle for anything less than Israel’s total destruction. Israel has been trying to deter Hamas and Hezbollah for decades.
Not surprisingly, it’s only worked sporadically.
Whenever Iran wants attacks against Israel to resume, Hamas and Hezbollah follow its orders. These terrorist groups are not deterrable because they are not the real decision-makers.
Only Iran can be deterred. But it is not being deterred because it’s allowed to benefit when these attacks occur.
Deterrence only works when the decision-makers themselves understand they will be severely hurt, not helped, if they take the actions we want deterred. The only way to stop Hamas’ and Hezbollah’s recurring attacks against Israel is to treat Iran as the attacker and punish it more than its puppet organizations.
This will not be easy to do, but there are several options, all of which require America’s cooperation. Israel alone can hurt Iran but not enough to serve as a permanent deterrent.
Primary among the options is the destruction of Iran’s nuclear-weapons program. If such an attack succeeded, it would be a win not only for Israel but for the entire region as well as for America and for peace.
But the risks of such an attack are considerable, especially if Israel must do it alone. With the help of the United States, the military risks would be reduced. The successful destruction of Iran’s nuclear program might weaken the government and could ultimately lead to regime change.
The bottom line is that unless Iran is severely punished for instigating terrorist attacks, these attacks will not be significantly deterred by Israeli military actions against the terrorist organizations.
Such actions may slow the terrorists down by destroying their weapons and infrastructure, but it won’t destroy their willingness to follow Iran’s directives. And Iran will certainly send more weapons and materiel.
Recall as well that Hamas and Hezbollah members are religious fanatics who are not deterred by the risk of death. They welcome becoming martyrs.
Iran, too, is run by religious fanatics, but they are calculating fanatics who would be deterred by credible threats to their nuclear program and regime. And many in the Iranian military, scientific and technological areas are more secular than their leaders and capable of being deterred.
This attack Iran orchestrated may provide Israel and the United States their best justification for doing what they have long wanted to do: destroy Iran’s nuclear-weapons program.
Although the international community would publicly criticize such a military action, many world leaders, including in Saudi Arabia and other Arab states, would understand and even welcome it because they realize the world will be better off if the terrorist state of Iran does not have a nuclear arsenal.
One point is clear: Iran is a legitimate military target for Israel. Iran, through its surrogates, has waged war on Israel.
Under international law, Israel has the right to retaliate militarily.
It also has the right to take preemptive military action to prevent the mullahs from obtaining nuclear weapons they have threatened to use against Israel.
A military attack on Iran’s nuclear program would be justified both on retaliatory and preventive grounds.

The Dallas captain is up to 15 goals on the season, with six in the past eight games, as the Stars finished 3-2 on a five-game homestand, the last of three that were their longest of the season.
The Stars and Colorado have a Central Division-leading 95 points, with Winnipeg trailing by two points while holding two games in hand on Dallas and one on the Avalanche.
Dallas has eight wins in 10 games, and the Avalanche extended their winning streak to eight games with a 6-1 victory over Columbus on Friday night. The Jets just had a three-game winning streak stopped.
""Everyone else keeps winning,"" said Benn, whose team plays its final six road games of the regular season in the next seven. ""So it's important for us to take advantage of these home games.""
Michael Bunting scored on Pittsburgh's third shot, but Jake Oettinger stopped the next 12 before Rickard Rakell's goal midway through the third period for the final margin.
Oettinger had 20 saves, including a pad stop on a wide-open Rakell when the lead was 3-1 in the second period.
The Penguins — in danger of missing the playoffs for the two straight seasons for the first time since 2005-06 — dropped to 2-10-2 in their past 14 road games.
""I like the way the team started,"" coach Mike Sullivan said. ""I thought there were instances where we needed to defend harder. I thought we had opportunities on the other end of the rink offensively where we simply have to execute and finish.""
Joe Pavelski's 25th goal pulled Dallas even in the first period, and Jason Robertson had his 47th and 48th assists for his fifth multipoint game in the past seven.
Sam Steel's goal early in the third period chased Penguins goalie Tristan Jarry, who was pulled after allowing four goals on 20 shots. Alex Nedeljkovic replaced Jarry.
""I'm not going to get into the reasons why,"" Sullivan said of pulling Jarry. ""But there were a number of reasons why I thought it was the right decision at that particular time for the team.""
Benn beat Jarry on the power play with a wrister off the inside of the post in the second period to put the Stars in front for good 22 seconds after Rakell was called for hooking.
The next goal for Benn came in transition when the 34-year-old shuffled the puck toward Jarry with Wyatt Johnston at the top of the crease and it went between the goalie's legs.
The Dallas victory was the second in a row for Oettinger after getting pulled in a 6-2 loss to New Jersey and not starting the next game even with a day off in between.
The 25-year-old is on pace for a career-high in goals-against average and a career-low in save percentage.
""He's been hard on himself,"" Robertson said. ""But he's been practicing hard, been on the ice, getting refocused. He showed up big tonight, and he's going to build on it.""
UP NEXT
Penguins: At Colorado on Sunday to wrap up a three-game trip.
Stars: Dallas takes a three-game road winning streak into Arizona for the opener of a four-game trip Sunday. The Stars beat the Coyotes 5-2 in Dallas on Wednesday.

The day celebrates the life of St. Joseph, ""the spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary, foster father of Jesus Christ, and patron of the universal Catholic Church,"" Fr. Angelo N. Carusi told Fox News Digital.
Carusi is pastor at St. Rocco’s Church in Johnston, Rhode Island.
TEXAS PRIEST REVEALS WHY ORTHODOX LENT BEGINS ON ‘CLEAN MONDAY’ WITH FORGIVENESS AND FASTING
St. Joseph's legacy remains influential even to this day, though there is not much about him written in the Bible.
""I think it’s rather amazing that there are no recorded words of St. Joseph in the Bible — and yet, there are more churches named after him and more images of him throughout the world than any other saint, except, of course, Jesus and Mary,"" said Fr. Carusi.
St. Joseph is particularly venerated by Italians and those of Italian descent, thanks to a purported miracle during a drought in Sicily in the 17th century, said Carusi.
Carusi's parish was established in the early 20th century to serve the growing Italian immigrant population in Johnston.
""In the church where I serve as pastor, St. Rocco's in Johnston, Rhode Island, there's a beautiful stained-glass window of St. Joseph, and on the bottom are etched these words, 'Ite ad Joseph,' which is Latin for, ‘Go to Joseph.’""
MAINE PRIEST, DURING LENT, URGES TAKING TIME TO ACKNOWLEDGE GOD'S CONSTANT PRESENCE AMONG US
And while the phrase ""Go to Joseph"" may seem simple, these words are ""so profound,"" said Carusi.
""If you’re having a problem in your marriage, go to Joseph. If you’re struggling as a father, go to Joseph. If you’re having a problem at work, go to Joseph. If you’re facing a grave illness or death, go to Joseph,"" he said.
Catholics believe in the intercession of the saints — meaning they ask a saint in heaven to pray for a certain outcome and intercede with Jesus Christ.
""St. Joseph is, for us, a model of faith, justice, hope, charity, obedience, tenacity and chastity,"" said Carusi.
He continued, ""In our world that is so secular, we need these virtues more than ever.""
STORY OF ST. PATRICK OFFERS IMPORTANT LESSONS DURING LENT, SAYS PENNSYLVANIA-BASED PRIEST
St. Joseph's Day is a solemnity, meaning it ""is the highest rank of celebration,"" said the Catholic Answers. This also means that even though it is during Lent each year, normal fasting rules do not apply as part of the celebration of the day.
""One beautiful tradition for St. Joseph’s Day is the St. Joseph’s Table,"" said Carusi.
The practice of the St. Joseph's Table started in Italy, after Sicilians asked St. Joseph to intercede and end a drought.
""Miraculously, it rained,"" he said.
""Their harvest was more plentiful than ever.""

To mark the miracle each year, families in Sicily began making a ""St. Joseph Table,"" which featured ""three tiers of various types of breads, pastas, thick vegetable soups, olives, figs, desserts, flowers and a statue or image of St. Joseph on the top tier,"" said Carusi.
It is also a custom to eat Italian pastries on St. Joseph's Day.
""Over the years, this tradition has become a living work of art,"" he added.
When Italians began moving to the United States, they brought these traditions with them.

It is also a custom to eat Italian pastries on St. Joseph's Day, particularly zeppole — deep-fried pastries topped with a maraschino cherry, said Carusi.

London — European Union regulators opened investigations into Apple, Google and Meta on Monday, the first cases under a sweeping new law designed to stop Big Tech companies from cornering digital markets. The European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's executive arm, said it was investigating the companies for ""non-compliance"" with the Digital Markets Act.
The Digital Markets Act that took effect earlier this month is a broad rulebook that targets Big Tech ""gatekeeper"" companies providing ""core platform services."" Those companies must comply with a set of do's and don'ts, under threat of hefty financial penalties or even breaking up businesses. The rules have the broad but vague goal of making digital markets ""fairer"" and ""more contestable"" by breaking up closed tech ecosystems that lock consumers into a single company's products or services.
The commission said in a press release that it ""suspects that the measures put in place by these gatekeepers fall short of effective compliance of their obligations under the DMA.""
EU Commissioner for ""A Europe Fit for the Digital Age"" Margrethe Vestager talks to media in the Berlaymont building, March 4, 2024 in Brussels, Belgium. Thierry Monasse/Getty
It's looking into whether Google and Apple are fully complying with the DMA's rules requiring tech companies to allow app developers to direct users to offers available outside their app stores. The commission said it's concerned the two companies are imposing ""various restrictions and limitations"" including charging fees that prevent apps from freely promoting offers.
Google is also facing scrutiny for not complying with DMA provisions that prevent tech giants from giving preference to their own services over rivals. The commission said it is concerned Google's measures will result in third-party services listed on Google's search results page not being treated ""in a fair and non-discriminatory manner.""
Google said that it has made ""significant changes"" to the way its services operate in Europe to comply with the DMA.
""We will continue to defend our approach in the coming months,"" Google's director of competition, Oliver Bethell, said.
In December, it was revealed that Google had agreed to pay $700 million and make several other concessions to settle allegations brought in the U.S. that it had been stifling competition against its Android app store.
The European Commission has slapped Google with antitrust penalties several times already, including a record $5 billion fine levied in 2018 over the search engine's abuse of the market dominance of its Android mobile phone operating system.
The commission is also investigating whether Apple is doing enough to allow iPhone users to easily change web browsers.
Apple said it's confident that its plan complies with the DMA, and it will ""continue to constructively engage with the European Commission as they conduct their investigations."" The company said it has created a wide range of new developer capabilities, features, and tools to comply with the regulation.
The California company is facing a broad antitrust lawsuit in the U.S., meanwhile, where the Justice Department has alleged that Apple illegally engaged in anti-competitive behavior in an effort to build a ""moat around its smartphone monopoly"" and maximize its profits at the expense of consumers. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have joined the suit as plaintiffs.
Apple has also previously fallen foul of the EU's regulators, with a first fine against the company imposed by the bloc only several weeks ago. In its first antitrust penalty against Apple, the European Commission fined the company almost $2 billion in early March for breaking its competition laws by unfairly favoring its own music streaming service over competitors'.
Meta, also no stranger to the wrath of European regulators, is being investigated by the commission over the option given to users to pay a monthly fee for ad-free versions of Facebook or Instagram, so they can avoid having their personal data used to target them with online ads.
""The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta's 'pay or consent' model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers,"" it said.
Meta said in a prepared statement that, ""Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries, and we designed Subscription for No Ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA. We will continue to engage constructively with the Commission.""
The EU fined Meta $1.3 billion about one year ago and ordered it to stop transferring European users' personal information across the Atlantic by October, in the latest salvo in a decadelong case sparked by U.S. cybersnooping fears. Meta called that decision by the commission flawed, and vowed to fight the fine.
The commission said it aims to wrap up its latest investigations into the American tech behemoths within 12 months."

MORE FROM FORBES Today's 'Wordle' #1019 Hints, Clues And Answer For Wednesday, April 3rd
Today’s my dad’s birthday. Happy birthday, dad!
Yesterday was Wordle Wednesday which means I gave all you phenomenal puzzle solvers a bonus riddle. Here’s what it was:
Three survivors of a plane crash are trapped on top of a plateau surrounded on all sides by sheer cliffs, 100 meters down to the ravine below. The narrowest point to safety is 100 feet across. All they have with them is a 20 foot ladder, a 10 foot ladder, a tank filled with gasoline, as much rope as they need, two books of matches, a 6 foot metal pole and an inflatable mattress. How do they get across to safety?
This riddle is all about distraction. In it, you’re given all these items and numbers and what not, but there’s only one item that matters: “as much rope as they need.” This is a bit of a trick, because you might think “Okay but how would we tie the rope from one side to the other? You could climb down on rope, but the riddle asks how you get across to safety.
The answer: You fill up the gorge with rope. If you have as much as you need that means you have effectively an infinite supply. Once it’s full of rope, you can walk across to safety.
Alright, let’s do this Wordle!
How To Solve Today’s Wordle

Today’s Wordle Etymology
The word 'climb' comes from the Old English climban, which means ""to climb, ascend; to strive eagerly, endeavor,"" and is a common Germanic word, with cognates in other languages such as Old Norse klifja, Dutch klimmen, German klimmen, and Old High German klimban. All these terms generally mean ""to climb,"" with the concept extending metaphorically to efforts and endeavors beyond the physical act of climbing.
The Proto-Germanic root is klimbanan, which likely comes from a PIE (Proto-Indo-European) root glei- meaning ""to stick"" or ""to adhere,"" suggesting the original sense involved clinging or sticking to something as one climbs, which nicely ties the physical action of climbing to the effort or struggle one might endure while climbing or striving to achieve something. Over time, 'climb' in English evolved to encompass a broad range of meanings, including ascending mountains, trees, or other steep surfaces, as well as metaphorical ascents like climbing the social ladder.

27509945-53b0-4e6a-be67-83d5de77e267,The Hundred 2023: Welsh Fire's Alex Griffiths and Alex Hartley are 'incredibly proud' of turnaround,"Last updated on .From the section The Hundred
Alex Hartley plays for Welsh Fire alongside her childhood coach Claire Nicholas
Welsh Fire's Alex Griffiths and Alex Hartley said the team can be ""incredibly proud"" of how they have turned their form around in 2023.
Last year Fire's women's team finished last in eighth place, picking up just two points and winning just one game.
But this season they have won four of their six games, and sit second in the table behind Southern Brave with qualification for the finals in reach.
""We can be incredibly proud of the turnaround we have had,"" said Hartley.
""We could do with Southern Brave losing one so we finish top and go straight through to the final but there is no expectations.
""Welsh Fire should qualify, we have got the team to win in our two remaining games.""
Fire face London Spirit this Sunday at Sophia Gardens, with a win ensuring qualification to the finals.
If they fail to beat Spirit it will set up a crucial final game against Northern Superchargers - who currently sit third.
Last time out against Trent Rockets, Welsh Fire's captain Tammy Beaumont broke records.
Beaumont hit the first century in the women's competition, while her spectacular score of 118 is the best in either the men's or women's competition to date.
""It was nuts wasn't it?"" said Hartley.
""It was almost like she was playing cricket on a computer game.
""It was unreal wherever they put the field she hit it somewhere else.
""She has been absolutely outstanding for us and really led the team from the front.
""She has spoken about the style of cricket we want to play and she has gone out there and done it herself.""
The Hundred has been revolutionary for the women's game, including a new initiative which is installing cricket pitches across Cardiff.
And the players hope their performances can inspire the next generation of cricketers.
Griffiths said: ""[Growing up] I was playing boys cricket. It was a lot of just getting peppered and sucking it up really.
""But the stuff that's happening now is way better than what I ever had when I was younger.
""Seeing the kids coming from different parts of the world to watch is really nice and I'm just buzzing about it.""
Hartley added: ""You can't be what you can't see and when I grew up women weren't playing cricket on the television.
""Now we are every day and every week, I love how many families come to the games and watch because that is what it's about."""

Kennedy Jr.’s campaign manager, Dennis Kucinich, begged President Joe Biden’s administration for Secret Service protection on Monday after a security scare on Friday.
Police arrested a man claiming to be a U.S. Marshal on Friday after he entered a Kennedy campaign event in Los Angeles and the presidential candidate has been unable to obtain Secret Service protection despite previously requesting it from the Biden administration. Kucinich’s letter discussed the potential danger at hand and invoked historic assassinations, including Kennedy’s family members, imploring Biden to grant the protection. (RELATED: Judge Denies RFK Jr’s Request For Restraining Order Against YouTube’s Censorship)
“I ask you in the spirit of patriotism, of fairness, and of good conscience to grant Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. the Secret Service protection that his circumstances so obviously warrant.” — @Dennis_Kucinich, in an open letter today to President Biden.https://t.co/cO0OalsdQW — Robert F. Kennedy Jr (@RobertKennedyJr) September 18, 2023
“The threat level to our candidate, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., is increasing every day,” Kucinich writes. “He is not the only one in danger — every person who attends a campaign event is at risk. A specter of violence haunts our political process. Indeed, political assassinations pose a grave threat to democracy. It is not hard to imagine the civil chaos and political disintegration that could ensue with the return of the kind of assassinations of public officials and presidential candidates that marred the 1960s.”
Kucinich reminded Biden that Kennedy’s father and uncle, President John F. Kennedy, were both assassinated.
“You and I have known each other for more than 50 years,” Kucinich adds. “I know that you do not want to see America reeling again from the consequences of another political assassination. Therefore, I ask you in the spirit of patriotism, of fairness, and of good conscience to grant Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. the Secret Service protection that his circumstances so obviously warrant.”
The man arrested on Friday allegedly possessed loaded pistols and spare magazines and posed as a U.S. Marshal, according to Kennedy in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. The man “identified himself as a member” of Kennedy’s security.
“I’m still entertaining a hope that President Biden will allow me Secret Service protection,” Kennedy added. “I am the first presidential candidate in history to whom the White House has denied a request for protection.”
The Kennedy campaign and the White House did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

b78d5a62-e7d9-408c-b3bd-ebff6bf94952,The 6 best window air conditioners in 2024,"CBS Essentials is created independently of the CBS News editorial staff. We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.
Midea
If you're dreading the summer heat, but don't want to spend a fortune on central air, consider a window AC unit or two. They can cool the rooms where you spend the most time and want to feel comfortable, without breaking your budget.
Depending on the size of the room you want to cool, window air conditioners come in a variety of sizes and strengths. And some even let you to control them with your smartphone.
If you think a portable air conditioner will serve your home cooling needs better, you'll definitely want to read out coverage of the six best portable air conditioners in 2024.
Which window air conditioner is the the best?
Whatever your needs or budget, our team of in-house appliance experts have curated this roundup of the best window air conditioners available right now.
Best window air conditioner: Midea U-shaped air conditioner (12,000 BTU)
Midea
If you're looking to cool a space smaller than 550 square feet, we recommend this Midea U-shaped air conditioner. It runs quietly (operating at less than 32 dB), offers 12,000 BTUs of cooling power and features a U-shaped design that makes it much easier to install into most windows.
Our favorite features include a dust filter and DC inverter technology uses 35% less energy compared with units from competitors.
But it's the smart functionality that we really like. Instead of using the included remote, you can control this air conditioner with an app on your iOS or Android smartphone, or using voice commands if you have an Amazon Alexa smart speaker or home hub. And yes, this air conditioner has received Energy Star certification and is competitively priced. What more could you possibly want from an air conditioner that'll keep you cool all summer long?
Best budget window air conditioner: Amazon Basics air conditioner (5,000 BTU)
Amazon
Best suited for smaller rooms and households on a budget, the Amazon Basics air conditioner doesn't offer a lot of fancy features, but it does provide easy installation and 5,000 BTUs of cooling power (enough for a room up to 150 square feet).
If you're not tech savvy, you'll appreciate that this AC unit has clearly labeled mechanical dials to control the unit. It fits in a window that's between 13 x 23 and 13 x 36 inches. Choose between seven temperature settings. You can even manually adjust the air direction. It comes with a window-mounting kit.
As part of the Amazon Basics product line, this air conditioner is backed by Amazon and has earned a solid 4.3 out of 5 star rating (based on more than 3,000 user ratings). And at just $150, it offers an excellent value for the money.
Best window air conditioner for a small room: GE Profile ClearView (6,100 BTU)
GE
We all know GE as the company that, since 1982, has been bringing ""good things to life."" In this case, plenty of goodness comes from this popular GE Profile ClearView window air conditioner that offers 6,100 BTUs of cooling power and generates only about 41 dB of noise. This makes it ideal for smaller spaces (up to 250 square feet).
This model fits windows between 20 and 40 inches wide, with a minimum 13-inch opening height. It can accommodate walls between 4.5 and 13.75 inches thick. While you get onboard controls and an included remote control, this ClearView AC unit also works with GE's SmartHQ app. This means you can remotely control the air conditioner from almost anywhere using your smartphone, or with an Amazon Alexa smart speaker or home hub.
The unit offers three fan speeds and four cooling modes. Meanwhile, the ClearView design allows the unit itself to wrap around a window sill. This means you can still look out the window and allow more natural light into a room. We like this air conditioner because it cools, circulates and dehumidifies the air simultaneously. And if 6,100 BTUs isn't enough power, this same model is available, with 8,300 BTUs ($432) of cooling power.
Best window air conditioner for a large room: Friedrich Kuhl KCM18A30A (20,000 BTU)
Friedrich
Designed to cool larger spaces -- up to 1,000 square feet -- this is one of the more powerful window air conditioners on the market, with 20,000 BTUs of cooling power. The unit itself also features a modern design and includes onboard digital controls, along with an included remote.
This air conditioner measures 17.93 x 25.93 x 29 inches. Within the unit itself there's a replaceable, commercial-grade air filter that helps to remove airborne pollutants as it cools. The slide-out chassis provides a more permanent installation.
Other features include quiet operation and smart functionality controllable using a smartphone or a smart speaker. Create a customizable, seven-day schedule for the unit using your smart phone. Plus, if you have multiple units installed, you can remotely control them individually or all at once using the same app. The Kuhl is very much a premium air conditioning unit that's sold at a premium price. It uses commercial-grade components, yet it's designed for in-home use.
Best quiet window air conditioner: Frigidaire Gallery (8,000 BTU)
Frigidaire
Higher-end air conditioners from well-known brands tend to have components that keeps noise level to a minimum. The folks at Frigidaire may do it best with this ""Inverter Quiet Temp"" air conditioner, which provides 8,000 BTUs of cooling power while keeping its noise below 41 dB. (For reference, the average noise level you'll hear inside a public library is between 40 and 50 dB.)
As an added bonus, this window air conditioner has won the Energy Star Most Efficient award, since it offers up to 46% annual energy savings over a standard air conditioner. The unit measures 14 x 38.8 x 22 inches and comes with a removable and washable dust filter. It's the ideal size and power for an average bedroom (or any space up to 350 square feet).
Along with onboard controls and the supplied remote, you can remotely control and program this AC unit with your smartphone, using the Frigidaire app. It also works with smart speakers or home hubs that are Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant compatible. Plus, using its built in auto-swing louver, the cool air reaches more angles for optimum circulation and cooling. And you can choose between three fan speeds. The price is pretty appealing, too.
Best smart window air conditioner for a small room: Midea U-shaped air conditioner (8,000 BTU)
Midea
Our top pick for best window air conditioner overall went to the more powerful (and more expensive) version of this Midea U-shaped air conditioner. This model offers an almost identical size and design, but is a bit less powerful (8,000 BTUs compared to 12,000 BTUs). Thus, it's better suited to a smaller space (up to 350 square feet).
This AC unit and our top pick, however, share the same smart tech.
While we certainly love the quiet operation (less than 32 dB) and energy efficiency of this air conditioner, it's the smart functionality we're most excited about. It's Wi-Fi enabled, so it can be controlled from anywhere using the companies iOS or Android app. You can also use voice commands throughout your house if you have a compatible Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant smart speaker or home hub.
Installation is easy using the included quick-snap bracket. Simply set the unit on the bracket and secure the sidearms. It works with single-hung or double-hung windows, with a width between 22 and 36 inches, and with a minimal height of 13.75 inches. Considering its sub-$400 price, you get a lot of features, smarts and cooling power for your investment.
What are BTUs and why are they important in an air conditioner?
The air conditioners we've included in this roundup offer between 5,000 to 20,000 BTUs of cooling power, but what does this mean? I's a unit of measurement that indicates how much energy an air conditioner uses per hour to cool your home. The higher the BTU rating, the more cooling power it has -- but the more energy it uses.
It's important to choose an air conditioner with enough power to cool your space, so before purchasing a window air conditioner for a specific room, measure that space and calculate its square footage. The best window AC unit should use 20 BTUs for each square foot of space you want it to cool. So, without you having to do any math, here's what that equates to:
100 to 149 square foot room = 5,000 BTU air conditioner
150 to 250 square foot room = 6,000 BTU air conditioner
251 to 300 square foot room = 7,000 BTU air conditioner
301 to 350 square foot room = 8,000 BTU air conditioner
351 to 400 square foot room = 9,000 BTU air conditioner
401 to 450 square foot room = 10,000 BTU air conditioner
451 to 500 square foot room = 12,000 BTU air conditioner
501 to 700 square foot room = 14,000 BTU air conditioner
701 to 1,000 square foot room = 18,000 BTU air conditioner
1,001 to 1,200 square foot room = 20,000 BTU air conditioner
Friedrich Air Conditioning recommends an extra 4,000 BTUs for a kitchen. If you search online, there are a few 25,000+ BTU window AC units, but they're expensive and hard to find in stock. For very large spaces, it often makes more sense to install two or more lesser powerful AC units, assuming you have multiple windows.
Most brands promote a unit's BTU power, as well as the square footage each model is best suited for. While you may be inclined to choose your air conditioner based on its appearance or price, if you use this strategy, you could easily wind up with a unit that's too weak for your space, or too much of an energy hog.
Other things to consider when choosing a window air conditioner include how much noise it makes, whether it comes with a window installation kit suitable for your home's window, its dimensions, and what features it offers (such as smart functionality or a remote control).
Be sure to pre-measure the window you plan to install the AC unit into to ensure that the air conditioner you select will fit. And to save money on your electric bill, we also recommend choosing a window air conditioner with Energy Star certification. Based on a window air conditioner's Energy Star certification, you could be entitled to a rebate, which will save you some additional cash.

Container ship DALI collided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge early Tuesday morning, collapsing a portion of the bridge and resulting in what authorities suspect is a mass casualty event.
According to previous reports, this is not the first time DALI has struck city infrastructure while transporting goods — a similar but far less serious incident was reported in 2016, according to contemporaneous reports.
2 PEOPLE RESCUED, SEVERAL MISSING AFTER SHIP STRIKE TRIGGERS BALTIMORE BRIDGE COLLAPSE
DALI collided with a stone wall at a dock in Antwerp, Belgium, in the afternoon of July 11, 2016, according to a Maritime News report.
The container ship suffered damage and was docked for repairs, but no one was injured in the collision, according to The New York Times.
The Tuesday incident was far more deadly, according to officials coordinating disaster response.
Emergency crews including the U.S. Coast Guard, local first responders and the FBI were searching for people believed to be in the water, Kevin Cartwright, director of communications for the Baltimore Fire Department said. Officials have described this as a mass casualty event.
AUTHORITIES RACE TO SAVE LIVES AFTER BRIDGE COLLAPSE AMID FRIGID WATER TEMPS
Baltimore Fire Chief James Wallace said at least two people were pulled from the water following the collapse, with one of them in serious condition.
Wallace said authorities ""may be looking for upwards of seven people"" but he said that number could change.
The vessel that struck the bridge was a Singapore-flagged cargo ship. The large vessel then caught fire before becoming disabled.

Footage of the incident shows the lights going out multiple times on the vessel in question prior to impact, suggesting the collision may have been due to a power failure.
The Maryland Transportation Authority said on social media that all lanes are closed in both directions and that traffic is being detoured. Later, it urged drivers to avoid the I-695 southeast corridor and to instead use I-95 or I-895.
Mayor Brandon M. Scott and Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. confirmed emergency personnel were responding, and rescue efforts were underway.
