The New York Times, for instance, published a lengthy article on Feb. 25 celebrating the “resettlement” of 170 migrant families who have been moved from city-paid hotel rooms to suburban Central Islip and other areas where they are being given upwards to $2,500 a month in free rent.
RELATED VIDEO — Dem NYC Councilman: Biden Should Bring Back Remain in Mexico:
One illegal from Venezuela, who moved from a Manhattan hotel — where she and her children had one room, a microwave, a mini-fridge, and a table and chair — into a spacious, two-bedroom apartment in the near eastern suburb, gushed about the program.
“To come from where we have come from, and to be here,” she marveled to the paper. “For some people this may be a small apartment, but for me this is huge.”
Martha Maffei, executive director of SEPA Mujer, one of the NGO groups working with the government to spread migrants across the region, told the Times that they are working to build relationships with landlords. But added, “it’s difficult because of how expensive it is.”
Many landlords worry that they will be stuck with indigent illegals once the government subsidies end.
Expense is also a problem for actual American citizens in the Big Apple.
Even as illegals are being handed free rent worth thousands, some New Yorkers are being expected to pay over a thousand dollars a month for an “apartment” that is barely bigger than a bedroom, one without a kitchen, and one that forces tenants to use a communal bathroom several yards down the hall.
While the above tiny room for $1,200 a month may not be the norm, other apartments that are not too much larger are going from $2,000 per month to more than $4,000 for cramped quarters with tiny bathrooms, little more than a breakfast nook for a kitchen, and small, narrow space connecting them.
Watch:
Meanwhile, it has been reported that regardless the program, state and city governments are the losers in Joe Biden’s migrant crisis. As billions of dollars are burned giving freebies to illegals to feed, clothe, house, and educate them, federal agencies are earning billions while cities and states end up on the losing end of the stick.
The federal government won an 8.7 percent profit of $37.5 billion from the resident population of 2.9 million refugees and asylum seekers in the 15 years before 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said in a recently published report.
However, the same report also revealed that the migrants inflicted a 7.3 percent loss of $21.4 billion on the taxpayers who fund state and local governments.
HHS calculated the costs by comparing the $739 billion in taxes paid by migrants and their families to their $723.4 billion in government aid.
But even this supposed profit margin of a tiny 2.1 percent was calculated by excluding many of the costs associated with government aid to migrants, such as the costs of welfare programs most of the migrants end up being enrolled in, and the costs of Medicare and Social Security.

[+] Images) Getty Images
Readers of a certain age can likely recall the iconic artwork that graced the album jackets of some of the biggest musical releases from a bygone era. While The Rolling Stone's ""Sticky Fingers,"" Pink Floyd's ""The Dark Side of the Moon,"" The Clash's ""London Calling"" and Joy Division's ""Unknown Pleasures"" would still be considered great albums regardless of their respective covers, it is almost impossible to separate the music from the artwork.
Serious thought and consideration was, and still is, put into the art that is tied to music.
However, in the era of streaming music, the visuals are often downplayed. YouTube Music has further turned the concept of accompanying artwork for music on its side this month when it introduced custom images that employed generative AI for playlists.
Instead of allowing users to upload their own artwork, the music streaming service is offering the ability for users to create original AI-generated art. Users select a category—from such options as animals, food and drink, colors, natural or travel—while various prompts further determine the ""style."" The AI then provides five different options, from which users can then use one of the images to represent the playlist.
Previously, YouTube Music had automatically created an image by merging the art from the first four songs in a user's playlist.
The new feature is available for U.S. users of YouTube Music, but the Google-owned company has plans to expand it to other regions and languages.
""The guided experience allows users to effortlessly explore from a range of visual themes and options to create one-of-a-kind cover art that expresses the uniqueness of your personal playlists. Struggling to find the perfect artwork for your 90's R&B-inspired morning commute playlist? Don't worry, we got you,"" YouTube Music's T. Jay Fowler, director of product management, said in a blog post.
AI-Generated Art And Music
It seems doubtful that AI can truly capture the same level of ""inspired"" artwork as those who were once hired to create the covers for albums.
""The link between art and popular music became especially tight in the 1960s-1970s when the work of avant-garde artists from R. Crump's for Big Brother's 'Cheap Thrills' to Stanlet Mouse and Alton Kelly–who provided several Grateful Dead LPs—to H.R. Giger for ELP's 'Brian Salad Surgery;' and well-known photographers, including Andy Warhol, Cindy Sherman, Ed Ruscha, Elliott Erwitt, Irving Penn, Lee Friedlander, Richard Avedon and William Eggleston made music LPs covers as memorable as the songs they offered,"" technology industry analyst Charles King of Pund-IT explained.
King added that while he doesn't have any issues with YouTube clients appending AI-generated artwork to their playlists, he suggested that it is little more than attempting to ""pretty up"" commercial products on the cheap.
""Since there are tens of thousands of talented artists looking for work, why doesn't YouTube hire them to create memorable playlist art and offer it to customers,"" King pondered. ""Probably because it involves a modest amount of money and risk. AI, on the other hand, is relatively inexpensive and risk-free. And entirely soulless and forgettable.""
Mixing It Up
The AI-generated artwork may not take any inspiration from the actual music on the playlist. Yet, back in the days of cassette ""mix tapes,"" artwork was never really a consideration either.
""The artwork associated with user-created collections has come a long way from people adding original artwork to mix tape labels,"" said Bruce Barber, professional in residence and general manager of 88.7 WNHU at the University of New Haven.
The bigger issues Barber said, is whether the AI producing the artwork will resonate with users in the same way as those now famous album covers, and how the music artists today may feel about it.
""Musicians and record companies have always been concerned with maintaining control of their art, and this must feel scary to both parties,"" Barber added.
Even the best AI-generated artwork will likely lack that special something. Can AI really come up with something as simple yet iconic as Andy Warhol's artwork for The Velvet Underground & Nico's debut album?
Probably not.
""In the end, YouTube's foray into AI-created images is likely to produce the kind of artwork you see in cheap hotels—bland, unmemorable and easily discarded,"" King maintained. ""Will YouTube customers really want to associate disposable, crap images with their favorite music? I hope not.""",www.forbes.com,AI Generated Art Now Available For YouTube Music Playlists,,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2023/10/28/ai-generated-art-now-available-for-youtube-music-playlists/,2023-10-01_2023-10-31,Conflict

COP28 was shrouded in controversy from the outset. The decision to choose a petrostate to host a climate conference was always going to raise questions.
The outcome from Dubai is far from perfect, but COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber has succeeded in planting the seeds of a move away from oil, coal and gas. The agreement by countries that fossil fuels need to be replaced with clean energy is historic. Now the hard work of implementation begins.
Leading businesses came to COP28 with a call for the phaseout of fossil fuels, the tripling of renewable capacity and the doubling of energy efficiency. Their voices were loud and clear and their message was heard, even if the language around fossil fuels in the final text talks of “transition” rather than a “phasing out,” as progressive companies and the vast majority of countries had supported.
The fact the text also recognizes the need to follow a 1.5C-aligned trajectory (keeping global warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius of preindustrial times), that it references emissions peaking at the latest before 2025 and that it mentions the need to get to net zero by 2050 is welcome.
And the inclusion of food and nature in the COP text is important given that a third of emissions comes from this sector. The pledge to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030 and the commitment by over 150 countries to put food in their next climate plans, so-called nationally determined contributions, is significant. Progressive businesses are already taking steps to ensure their supply chains do not lead to the loss of forests and that the products they use come from sustainable agricultural practices.
However, for all companies, industries and countries to be able to genuinely begin the transition away from fossil fuels, governments must give a clear steer in their climate plans, which the text says should be delivered from late 2024, showing how they will implement and manage the change they have agreed.
They also need to show much more precisely how the transition will be paid for. The final text agreed to in Dubai includes very little detail about finance. The document acknowledges the need for significant investment but includes no concrete numbers. This omission will need to be corrected quickly if the transition is to be delivered in line with climate science, and all countries, including the poorest, are able to adopt cleaner technologies.
Today can be the dawn of a new era. The agreement in Dubai is the skeleton on which a different future can be built, but planning for this future needs to begin immediately. COP30 in Belen (Brazil) will be the next important milestone when the Nationally Determined Contributions—countries’ plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change—should be updated. With the Global Stocktake—an inventory that takes stock of the world’s progress on climate action—clearly acknowledging that we are off track to meet the climate objectives, everyone should focus on the job of electrification and rolling out renewables, whose falling cost trajectory is acknowledged by the COP28 text, and ridding the world of oil, coal and gas.
Businesses need a clear vision and a coherent plan from policymakers if they are to deliver on scaling up clean energy solutions, phasing out fossil fuels and cutting emissions from their operations and supply chains.",www.forbes.com,COP28 Ushers In The Beginning Of The End Of The Fossil Fuel Era,,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariamendiluce/2023/12/13/cop28-ushers-in-the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-fossil-fuel-era/,2023-12-01_2023-12-31,Environment

It's often best to be concise. Here are five ways to be both brief and effective while communicating.,https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsweek.com%2Fless-more-workplace-communications-1812842.json,https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2257841/work-meeting.jpg,en,,"Suppose your team leader proposed an idea like this:
""[The idea] will make us more productive, effective, powerful and efficient. It will also make it easier for us to on-board new employees, document and measure our goals and progress, and attract new partners and sponsors. It will also be inexpensive and easy to implement quickly, and our IT team says it will be compatible with our existing programs, apps and devices.""
The leader might think: ""Eleven benefits in three sentences—nailed it!""
But without looking back at that paragraph, how many of those benefits could you repeat? And even if you could repeat them all (congratulations on your photographic memory), which of those benefits are most important?
The answers are difficult, if not impossible, to get. When a speaker shares many ideas at once, each point fights for attention in the listener's brain simultaneously, diluting the impact of all of them.
Listeners also need more time to comprehend the idea a speaker conveys. While the speaker is well acquainted with the idea, the audience is hearing it for the first time.

Audience members will not only listen to the idea but digest it, ponder it, consider its relevance and decide whether to write it down. Meanwhile, the speaker is several sentences down the road, and some of those missed ideas may be just as important, if not more so, than the first one still being processed.
How to Keep Communication Brief but Effective
As I often like to say to my workshop participants: Say many things and they will remember none. Say some things and they will remember some. But say ONE thing, and they will remember ALL.
This phrase may sound similar to the adage ""less is more,"" but what it really means is ""more is less.""
No stranger to problem-solving, Albert Einstein diagnosed the challenge and hinted at the solution when he said, ""If you can't say it simply, you don't understand it well enough.""
I interpret this to mean that brevity is not simply about chopping words. It means understanding your core message thoroughly enough to recognize which parts must be preserved and which parts can be discarded.
These five tactics can help you deliver a point that's clear, not convoluted:
1. Know Your 'Need-to-Know' vs. Your 'Neat-to-Know'
Audit your message by identifying ""need-to-know"" points (ideas your audience needs to understand) and your ""neat-to-know"" points (ideas the audience might find interesting). If you're not sure, ask someone as you practice.
Once you've identified your ""need-to-knows,"" focus on them and disregard—or at least deemphasize—the rest. Unless you're a comedian, your most powerful point is always ""need to know,"" never ""neat to know.""
2. Identify and Remove Redundant Ideas
Wherever you see a list of words or concepts (usually connected by the word and), ask yourself: Do I need all these descriptors that tax my audience's attention or are some of them virtually synonyms?
Even if they're not synonyms, is one vastly more important than the other? Also, check to see if a description renders an adjective unnecessary.
When you remove redundant and less important ideas, chances are that you'll gain more in audience retention than you'll lose in word rejection.
As a quick test, which of these two phrases can you more easily process? And how much of the big idea is lost in the skinny version?
This effective and productive campaign will excite and inspire our most important and relevant customers to love and adore our product. (23 words, four ands) This campaign will inspire our most important customers to adore our brand. (13 words, 0 ands)
In the first example:
The description illustrates productivity and effectiveness, making the words effective and productive unnecessary.
Excite and inspire are virtual synonyms.
Love and adore are synonyms.
The second example removes redundancy to more clearly state the point.
3. Convey More, Explain Less
Explaining is often a defensive act. We think the audience doesn't understand something, so we explain it.
But in that scenario, explaining primarily serves to remedy a failed expression. When you focus on conveying points instead of explaining ideas (or educating or informing your audience), you'll communicate more precisely.
Communication pathologist and neuroscientist Caroline Leaf says that overexplaining can be a trauma response linked to a desire to people please. So overexplainers may be trying to subconsciously ""regulate other people's emotional states.""
Explaining, educating and informing also focus on what you know and say, which is misguided. Conveying and delivering is about what your audience hears and receives, which is more important because, at the end of the day, if your point isn't successfully received, there's no point in giving the speech.
4. Limit Paragraphs to Three Sentences
If you're writing your idea in a document or email, try to cap paragraphs to three sentences or less (as I've done throughout this article). This tactic makes it easier for readers to digest your points because they have smaller chunks to process.
And because you're writing in short, direct points versus long pieces of text, you may find yourself writing less overall. Everyone—even students—benefit from applying this easy rule.
5. Hear Your Words
No matter how much you review your own writing, hearing it aloud will always identify redundancies and places to cut. You can read it aloud yourself or use the ""Read Aloud"" feature in Microsoft Word, which enables you to customize the voice by speed and gender. Other editing tips include changing the size or font of your writing—anything that will help you see it with fresh eyes.
Achieving more by saying less is not about wordsmithing but about point awareness. When you say even one word more than you need to, you make your point one word harder for your audience to receive. This is partly why nobody ever complains about a speech that runs short versus a speech that runs long.
So follow Einstein's lead in all your workplace communications: Know your point well enough to express it simply and remember that more is less.

Judge Arthur Engoron, earlier this month, imposed a partial gag order to prevent all parties from engaging in any verbal attacks against court staff after Trump criticized a member of the judge’s office on social media.
JUDGE IMPOSES PARTIAL GAG ORDER IN TRUMP ORG. TRIAL BLOCKING PARTIES FROM VERBAL ATTACKS AGAINST COURT STAFF
""On October 3, during a break in this trial, defendant Donald Trump posted to his social media account an untrue, disparaging, and personally identifying post about my Principal Law Clerk,"" Engoron wrote in a filing Friday, adding that he ordered Trump to remove the post ""immediately.""
The post in question was on Trump's Truth Social account, and stated Engoron's law clerk had a relationship with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. The post also contained a photo. Trump added that because of that, the case ""should be dismissed immediately.""
""Approximately 10 minutes later, Donald Trump represented to me that he had taken down the offending post, and that he would not engage in similar behavior going forward,"" Engoron wrote, adding that he then imposed the partial gag order, which emphasized that ""personal attacks on members of my court staff are unacceptable, inappropriate, and I will not tolerate them under any circumstances.""
TRUMP JUDGE FACES ONLINE BACKLASH AFTER SMILING, POSING FOR CAMERAS IN COURTROOM: 'PARTISAN DEMOCRAT CLOWN'
""Despite this clear order, last night I learned that the subject offending post was never removed from the website ‘DonaldJTrump.com,’ and, in fact, had been on that website for the past 17 days,"" Engoron wrote. ""I understand it was removed late last night, but only in response to an email from this Court.""
Engoron said lawyers for Trump stated that the violation of the gag order was ""inadvertent and was an ‘unfortunate part of the process that is built into the campaign structure.’""
But Engoron said, either way, Trump ""violated the gag order.""
""Donald Trump has received ample warning from this Court as to the possible repercussions of violating the gag order,"" he wrote. ""He specifically acknowledged that he understood and would abide by it.""
He added: ""issuing yet another warning is not longer appropriate; this Court is way beyond the ‘warning; stage.""
JUDGE IMPOSES PARTIAL GAG ORDER AGAINST TRUMP IN SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH'S JAN 6 CASE
Engoron said that given Trump’s position that the violation was ""inadvertent,"" and even that it is the ""first time"" violation, the court will impose a ""nominal fine"" of $5,000.
""Make no mistake: future violations, whether intentional or unintentional, will subject the violator to far more severe sanctions, which may include, but are not limited to, steeper financial penalties, holding Donald Trump in contempt of court, and possibly imprisoning him pursuant to New York Judiciary Law.""
The trial comes after James, a Democrat, brought a lawsuit against Trump last year alleging he and his company misled banks and others about the value of his assets. James claimed Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric, as well as his associates and businesses, committed ""numerous acts of fraud and misrepresentation"" on their financial statements.
TRUMP JUDGE FACES ONLINE BACKLASH AFTER SMILING, POSING FOR CAMERAS IN COURTROOM: 'PARTISAN DEMOCRAT CLOWN'
An appellate ruling from over the summer, which limited James from suing for alleged transactions that occurred before July 13, 2014, or Feb. 6, 2016, depending on the defendant, dismissed Ivanka Trump as a defendant.
Trump has blasted James for bringing the lawsuit; for the trial not having a jury; and Engoron, calling him ""corrupt.""
""The Attorney General filed this case under a consumer protection statute that denies the right to a jury,"" a Trump spokesperson said. ""There was never an option to choose a jury trial. It is unfortunate that a jury won’t be able to hear how absurd the merits of this case are and conclude no wrongdoing ever happened.""
Engoron, last month, ruled that Trump and the Trump Organization committed fraud while building his real estate empire by deceiving banks, insurers and others by overvaluing his assets and exaggerating his net worth on paperwork used in making deals and securing financing.
Engoron’s ruling came after James sued Trump, his children and the Trump Organization, alleging that the former president ""inflated his net worth by billions of dollars,"" and said his children helped him to do so.
Meanwhile, a federal judge also imposed a partial gag order against Trump this week, blocking him from making statements targeting Special Counsel Jack Smith , his staff, witnesses and court personnel.
U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan of the District of Columbia, who is presiding over Smith’s case against the former president for charges related to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, made the decision during a court hearing on Monday.

Chutkan said Monday that the former president is able to criticize the Justice Department in general terms and has the right to post his view that the case against him is politically motivated. However, the judge said Trump cannot post attacks against prosecutors or court staff.
""No other criminal defendant would be allowed to do so, and I'm not going to allow it in this case,"" Chutkan said, adding that, if necessary, she would impose sanctions if Trump violates the partial gag order.",www.foxnews.com,New York judge fines Trump $5K for violating partial gag order in civil fraud trial,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-york-judge-fines-trump-5k-violating-partial-gag-order-civil-fraud-trial,2023-10-01_2023-10-31,Law

The meteoric rise of Generative AI, with technologies like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Meta’s LLaMA, Google’s BARD and so on, has ushered in a new era of business innovation and technological advancement. However, the toll these technologies take on our environment often goes unnoticed. In this piece, I integrate the essential concept of Prompt Engineering with my previously introduced ReUse, Regenerate and ReTune framework to offer a comprehensive strategy that addresses both the environmental and operational aspects of Generative AI.
Understanding the Hidden Costs
Before diving into our multi-faceted framework, it's vital to consider the environmental costs of Generative AI. Estimates suggest that OpenAI consumes about 500 ml of water for every 20 to 50 questions it processes. While companies like Microsoft may offer carbon-neutral solutions, the entire supply chain likely isn't as green.
There is the “Consumer Side” and the “Designer Side.” The Designers are the architects who take the responsibility of “making it work” technically using processes and technology for users or “consumers.” One of the key aspects is Prompt Engineering for them beyond usual DataOps and MLOPs. Let's look at each of them.
Prompt Engineering, a technique crucial for enhancing the output of large language models (LLMs), has become an indispensable part of the modern AI landscape. In the context of sustainability, Prompt Engineering operates in tandem with principles like Continuous Intelligence, Continuous Feedback Management and Continuous Integration, often abbreviated as LLMOPs (Language Large Models Optimization Practices). Here's how these elements integrate to not only improve model performance but also its sustainability.
Six Pillars of Prompt Engineering
1. Precision
Continuous Intelligence: By continuously feeding real-time data and using advanced analytics, AI models can become smarter over time. The smarter the model, the fewer computational resources it needs to answer queries, thereby directly contributing to sustainability.
2. Relevance
Continuous Feedback Management: User-generated feedback can be invaluable in aligning the model's output with the desired task. Through automated loops of feedback, the model can more accurately gauge what is contextually relevant, reducing the need for computational iterations.
3. Optimization
Continuous Integration: The principle of Continuous Integration allows models to be updated regularly, reducing errors and refining their efficiency. This pillar benefits significantly from the data pipeline, which ensures that only relevant and optimized data is fed into the model, thereby reducing wastage of computational resources.
4. Model
Continuous Intelligence: Constant data input and analytics can help the model adapt and improve, which aligns closely with this pillar. A continuously intelligent model will require fewer resources to generate equally accurate, or even more accurate, outputs.
5. Performance
Continuous Feedback Management: Real-time feedback can dynamically adjust the performance metrics of an AI model. This continuous refinement ensures that the model's effectiveness is consistently high, thereby indirectly reducing the computational load and power consumption.
6. Customization
Continuous Integration: By integrating new features and capabilities seamlessly, the model can be tailored more closely to specific tasks or industries. This cuts down the computation required for general-purpose processing, again contributing to lower resource usage.
Synergizing for Sustainability through LLMOPs
Data Pipeline
A well-designed data pipeline is essential for feeding quality data into the model. Through Continuous Intelligence, this pipeline becomes more refined, only including data that contributes positively to the model's 'Precision' and 'Relevance.'
Model Iterations
Continuous Feedback Management enables the model to learn quickly from its mistakes, rapidly iterating to improve 'Performance' and 'Optimization.'
Refactoring
Refactoring of code and model architecture, enabled by Continuous Integration, ensures that the model remains efficient ('Model') and adaptable ('Customization').
By integrating the six pillars of Prompt Engineering with Continuous Intelligence, Continuous Feedback Management and Continuous Integration, we can significantly improve the model's performance while reducing its environmental footprint. This approach offers a structured pathway to making Generative AI more sustainable without compromising on its capabilities for Designers to make an efficient AI System
Consumer Side: As consumers—business leaders to analysts, we also need to take a few steps. Let me highlight some of the ways to work on it and make a “difference”
ReUse: Responsible Consumption through ""Prompt Pattern Dictionary""
For Users
Limit Token Usage: This aligns with the 'Precision' pillar of Prompt Engineering. The more precise and succinct your query, the fewer computational resources are required to generate an answer. This principle underscores the need for individual users to be aware of their token usage.
For Analysts
Caching Responses: This is in synergy with the 'Optimization' pillar. Instead of regenerating content, frequently accessed responses can be cached. By doing so, redundant calculations are avoided, significantly reducing energy usage and, by extension, the model’s environmental impact. Simple, create a DB which can store your ""Prompts Pattern Dictionary.""
Regenerate: Renewable Practices
For Users
Time your Queries: Aligned with the 'Optimization' pillar, timing your queries during low-demand hours can alleviate the pressure on power grids, especially those that still rely on non-renewable energy sources.
For Analysts
Green Data Centers: The 'Performance' pillar mandates the efficacy of your systems. Opting for hosting services that operate using renewable energy not only benefits the environment but also can improve the overall efficiency and performance of AI services.
ReTune: Efficiency Above All
For Users
Choose Efficient Models: This concept connects with the 'Model' pillar. Models that are optimized for performance but are less resource-intensive should be the go-to option for responsible usage.
For Analysts
Model Efficiency: The 'Customization' pillar urges the fine-tuning of models to specific tasks, thereby reducing the overheads of general-purpose models. Lighter, task-specific models can be much more energy-efficient, helping to cut down on electricity usage and resultant emissions.
By combining Prompt Engineering strategies with the ReUse, Regenerate and ReTune framework and processes like ""Prompt Pattern Dictionary"" and LLMOPs, we have the tools at hand to pave the way for a more sustainable future in Generative AI. The time to act is now!

In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, quantum computing has emerged as a force with far-reaching implications. As the chief technologist of a company that is leading the development of a reconfigurable atom-denominated quantum computer, I've been passionate about the future of computational power and its many potential applications.
Leaders in a variety of fields, from environmental protection to supply chain management, might find themselves at the intersection of how quantum computing will eventually affect their work. To get leaders future-thinking, I asked seven members of Forbes Technology Council Quantum Computing, a community of industry experts that I lead, one practical use or need for employing quantum technology that companies need to consider now. Here's how it will influence complex issues and why it shouldn't be dismissed as a simple scientific curiosity.
1. Reduced Carbon Footprint
I will consider quantum computing for finetuning large language models (LLMs) for two reasons. First, LLMs take a lot of processing power and time in optimization. This not only costs time and money but is also not eco-friendly. Second, with quantum computing as a platform, we can augment the processing and finetuning to help the environment by reducing carbon footprint. - Kiran Palla, AVS Academy
2. Optical Atomic Clocks
If we are talking about quantum technology and not just quantum computing, there are many practical uses. Perhaps the most immediate is the application of optical atomic clocks for improving throughput for distributed data workloads and enabling more efficient spectrum utilization for telecommunications. Also broad applications of quantum sensors for navigation in GPS-denied and GPS-contested environments. - Paul Lipman, Infleqtion
3. Product Roadmap Optimization
At this stage, only quantum annealer technology is showing real-world readiness, which lends itself well to optimization solutions in highly dimensional and complex spaces. The strategic management of many company aspects is an example—if those aspects can be defined. These areas include product management or roadmap optimization, sales territory optimization and pricing structure optimization. - Vincent Berk, Quantum Xchange
4. Specialized Algorithms
Optimization and machine learning, as it is ubiquitous, and the time to bring up teams and specialized algorithms is 3-5 years, possibly already late for those who have not yet entered - Yehuda Naveh, Classiq Technologies
5. Weakened RSA
The biggest concern with quantum tech (QT) is its impact on the RSA algorithm used for securing websites and services. As QT advances, RSA will be vulnerable, allowing bad actors to decrypt cached encrypted data. Transitioning to quantum-safe algorithms is crucial to safeguard against such threats. The hardware selection should consider quantum-resistant options to mitigate security risks and maintain data confidentiality. - Suman Sharma, Procyon Inc.
6. Eased Traffic Congestion
Quantum computing's problem-solving prowess could ease urban traffic congestion through real-time traffic flow and route optimization. - Mani Padisetti, Digital Armour
7. Optimized Supply Chain Management
Companies should explore quantum-enhanced optimization for supply chain management. Quantum algorithms can efficiently solve complex optimization problems, such as route optimization, inventory management and resource allocation. Quantum technology in supply chain operations can lead to significant cost reductions, increased efficiency and streamlined logistics, ultimately enhancing overall business performance. - Jagadish Gokavarapu, Wissen Infotech

Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" is a wild spectacle about mortality, gender, and consumerism — all clad in a wash of pink.
The film, which takes place in both the real world (patriarchal society) and Barbieland (a matriarchal pocket dimension), takes Barbie (and Ken) on a journey of self-discovery. Barbie learns that women can get old, and contain multitudes. Ken learns that men can actually be more than accessories whose only job is to ""beach.""
Amid the chaos, ""Barbie"" also takes on the ""softboi"" archetype — an artsy, patronizingly considerate kind of guy with a superiority complex.
[Warning: Spoilers for ""Barbie"" ahead.]

Ken brings his newfound knowledge of the patriarchy back to Barbieland, quickly flipping the status quo to put the Kens on top.
In order to take back their world, the Barbies must free their peers from the grip of patriarchal thought and distract the Kens from their positions of power. They do that by catering to their most ""softboi"" tendencies: mansplaining, faux sensitivity, and hipster posturing.
The film's assorted Kens are more than happy to explain ""The Godfather"" to hapless, ignorant Barbies, name-dropping producer Robert Evans in the process because they are connoisseurs of cinéma. Or perhaps they could reveal to a Barbie how beautiful she actually is with her glasses off — after all, how could she ever know her own beauty? Maybe Ken could even serenade Barbie for literal hours with ""Push"" by Matchbox Twenty. To be clear, these are all things that actually happen in the film.

Ultimately, Ken — all the Kens — isn't very smart. To be fair, the guy basically learned what it means to be a man from a middle school library and one trip to Century City. His masculine identity is a bizarre mish-mash of odd signifiers like horses and ""brewski beers"" as a result.
But by targeting the ""softboi,"" ""Barbie"" paints a more comprehensive portrait of modern masculinity, spoofing an archetype that's been the subject of discourse in recent years. Combined with Ryan Gosling's excellent performance as the pathetic, but empathy-inspiring Ken, it's an absolute delight.
The Barbies topple the Kens through playing to these ""softboi"" tendencies, distracting them by playing to their superiority complexes and eventually turning them against each other through jealousy. It's a silly, but effective, display of feminine collective action — and one that only requires some batting of the eyes and abandoning your Ken to listen to some other guy play the guitar.",www.insider.com,'Barbie' Targets Toxic 'Softboy' Masculinity Through Ken,,,https://www.insider.com/barbie-ken-toxic-masculinity-softboy-patriarchy-2023-7,2023-07-01_2023-07-31,Entertainment

The trial in New York City wrapped up one day earlier with attorneys for the writer E. Jean Carroll and Trump making their closing arguments, following seven days of testimony from witnesses for Carroll, who says Trump raped her decades ago.
""Donald Trump has an M.O.,"" and that is targeting women in ""semi-public"" places and ""grabbing"" their genitals, Carroll's attorney, Roberta Kaplan, said Monday during closing arguments in the civil defamation and battery trial. But what Kaplan said is Trump's ""M.O."" his attorney Joe Tacopina called ""a distraction,"" from what he said was a lack of evidence supporting Carroll's claims.
Kaplan reminded the jury that for the battery charge, ""all you need is that it is more probable than not"" that Trump attacked Carroll to find him liable, a much lower standard than the ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" standard applied in criminal trials.
Attorneys for Trump did not call any witnesses and he did not testify in the trial. Tacopina said that was because ""challenging (Carroll's) story is our defense."" He added, ""There were no witnesses to call.""
""Donald Trump doesn't have a story to tell other than to say it was a lie,"" Tacopina said.
Tuesday morning, Trump posted on Truth Social, saying he was ""not allowed to speak or defend myself, even as hard nosed reporters scream questions about this case at me."" Trump was permitted to testify in his own defense, but chose not to.
Carroll says Trump assaulted and raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in Manhattan in the mid-1990s, and then defamed her when she went public with the accusation in 2019. Trump, who has claimed he never met Carroll and ""she's not my type,"" has strenuously denied her accusations.
Those claims are at the center of Carroll's defamation argument against Trump. The jury watched the moment in Trump's videotaped deposition when he was shown a late 1980s photo that included both him and Carroll, and he incorrectly identified Carroll as his ex-wife Marla Maples.
Carroll herself testified during the trial, relaying a detailed account of her accusation, which was first published in 2019 in New York magazine as an excerpt from her book, ""What Do We Need Men For?: A Modest Proposal.""
Carroll, then about 52, said she bumped into Trump, then about 50, while exiting the store one evening. She said Trump recognized her, saying ""Hey, you're that advice lady,"" referring to a column she has written for nearly three decades. She said she replied, ""Hey, you're that real estate tycoon.""
Carroll said Trump told he wanted advice on a gift purchase for a girl. She described pleasant, ""joshing"" banter between the two as they walked through the store, even after he suggested they go to the lingerie department.
But things took a sudden turn when they went to a dressing room, she said. Carroll said Trump quickly shut the door and pushed her against the wall, her head slamming against it. She said Trump forcefully penetrated her with his hand, causing severe pain, and then penetrated her with his penis. Carroll said she was able to wedge her knee between them, pushing him away before leaving as fast as she could.
She described telling two other people about the alleged attack, in the moments and day after, friends Lisa Birnbach and Carol Martin. Both were called to testify during the trial, delivering testimony that largely matched Carroll's recollection.
Other witnesses called by Carroll included a clinical psychologist, two former Bergdorf Goodman employees and two other women who described alleged attacks by Trump. Jurors also listened to an ""Access Hollywood"" clip in which Trump could be heard crudely describing grabbing women by their genitals.
Trump's lawyers sought to pick apart the allegations brought forth by Carroll and the other women, Jessica Leeds and Natasha Stoynoff. Attorney Joe Tacopina zeroed in on Carroll's inability to say conclusively exactly when, other than either late 1995 or early 1996, the alleged attack occurred, and noted that she did not identify Thursday as the likely day of the week the attack allegedly occurred until trial.
The jury heard testimony from a former Bergdorf's manager who said in the 1990s the store was open late on Thursdays, though at times sparsely staffed — typically with few shoppers or attendants near the sixth floor lingerie department.
Jurors were shown emails and text messages between Carroll, Martin and Birnbach that appeared to show their animosity to Trump, who was then the president, as the defense tried to portray an effort by the trio to use Carroll's story to tarnish him.
Jurors began deliberations Tuesday to decide if Trump is liable for the alleged attack, and if he defamed Carroll after she came forward.

By opening a CD before the next Federal Reserve meeting savers can lock in a high rate now. SDI PRODUCTIONS/Getty Images
For much of 2023, a certificate of deposit (CD) was a great way to boost your savings and protect your principle. CD interest rates grew exponentially thanks to surging inflation and decades-high interest rates meant to tame it.
And, depending on your location and personal factors, you could have secured a 6% or even 7% interest rate. Compared to the 1% rates or lower from 2020 and 2021, that was a significant amount of money to be made simply by transferring your funds from one account type to another.
But as 2023 evolved inflation fell and interest rate hikes were put on pause. Now, in 2024, there are serious talks about a cut to the benchmark interest rate range. And with the first Federal Reserve meeting set to take place at the end of January, many savers may be wondering if they should still open a CD. Below, we'll break down three reasons why it may be worth it to do so.
Start by exploring your CD account options here to see how much more you could be earning.
Should you open a CD before the January Fed meeting?
Here are three compelling reasons why you should consider opening a CD before the Federal Reserve meets on January 30.
Rates are still high
CD interest rates are still high right now, so if you haven't taken advantage you still can. While, historically, rates have usually been higher on long-term CDs versus short-term ones, the opposite is often true now. Still, you can earn significantly more no matter which you choose.
How much more can you expect? Using a $5,000 deposit as an example, savers could expect to earn $225 over 12 months with a short-term CD at a 4.5% interest rate. And you can likely find a better rate simply by shopping around online.
Get started with a top CD account here now.
Rates have likely plateaued — and may drop soon
While CD rates are elevated now they've likely plateaued and may even fall soon. Even if the Fed doesn't cut rates in their January meeting many expect them to do so later in the year, possibly as soon as March. When they do, rates on CDs will fall with them.
So don't wait for that to happen. If you do, you'll lose out on free money that you could've got simply by depositing some of your money into a top-earning CD. And if your existing funds are sitting in a regular savings account now, with an average return of just 0.47%, you're already losing money.
You'll earn more interest than the alternatives
Still not convinced that now is an opportune time to open a CD? Then explore the alternatives. As noted, the rates on regular savings accounts are barely existent. High-yield savings accounts, meanwhile, have competitive rates almost as high as the best CDs.
But unlike CDs that have their rate locked until the account matures, rates on high-yield savings accounts are variable and subject to change. And with the potential for rate cuts this year high, they may not be as favorable for many savers as a CD could be.
The bottom line
CDs have been a great option for millions of savers over the last year but that window of opportunity could soon be closing. If inflation stays in check the Fed could soon follow with interest rate cuts, thus reducing the returns savers could get on CD accounts. By acting now, then, they could still lock in a high rate before that happens. And they can likely earn more than some alternatives, too. Still, the decision to lock your money away for an extended period of time is a personal one, so savers will want to do their research and compare all of their options before getting started.

Elizabeth Alexander, the communications director for first lady Jill Biden, went on temporary leave last month to help lead the messaging arm of Biden’s campaign. She previously served as the president’s spokesperson when he was in the Senate and when he was vice president. She also worked on the president’s 2020 campaign as a senior adviser for communications.
Alexander got married in 2010 to David Wade, a Yale University lecturer and public affairs strategist who served as the chief of staff to then-Sen. John Kerry and to the State Department under the Obama administration.
Wade left the State Department on June 17, 2015, and started a consulting firm called GreenLight Strategies a couple months later, according to his LinkedIn. On Sept. 14, 2015, Wade reached out to Eric Schwerin, the president of Hunter's now-dissolved Rosemont Seneca Partners, about helping Hunter and the firm with ""rapid response.""
ANOTHER BIDEN CAMPAIGN CO-CHAIR HAS TIES TO HUNTER, ASKED FOR HIS BRIEFING ‘ON THE UKRAINE’
""Eric: not sure if you've done any more thinking on your end, but I wanted to come back to you on what we talked about the other day,"" Wade said, appearing to refer to Burisma based on other emails that would follow. ""My sense is that the initial project would take me probably 30 hours or so to do the meetings/conference calls with you and Hunter and anyone else you thought could be helpful in the orbit to do the research and map all the potential issues that might come up and then I'd draft talking points and back-up documents and quotes – all the collateral documents – to have on hand as a playbook for rapid response – all the collateral documents we'd want – so that the team would be ready.""
Wade requested $10,000 for the initial project, and Schwerin forwarded the request to Hunter, saying that he and Devon Archer were on board with the proposal. Archer also served on Burisma’s board with Hunter.
The email to Schwerin came after correspondence earlier that year when Hunter told Wade he heard that he was making the jump from the State Department to the private sector and that he was ""always just a phone call away.""
""If you have time, I'd definitely like to pick your brain for advice,"" Wade said to Hunter. ""Elizabeth and I both look forward too [sic] catching up.""
Two weeks after Wade's email to Schwerin, Hunter was scheduled to have a meeting with Wade on Oct. 1, 2015, according to an email of his schedule, which was also sent to Schwerin.
HUNTER BIDEN'S CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS DAD'S NEW CAMPAIGN CO-CHAIR REVEALED IN LAPTOP EMAILS
One week later, Hunter was scheduled to have a phone call with Wade and possibly Schwerin.
Days later, on Oct. 14, 2015, Schwerin sent an email to Hunter, Wade and Archer about how they were preparing to respond to multiple questions from the Wall Street Journal.
""Hunter/Devon/David,"" Schwerin wrote. ""Sending simultaneously to all for comments. Just wanted to do some if asked talking points that I would provide on background to the WSJ.""
""Thanks Eric. Great stuff, as always,"" Wade responded. ""My gut would be to tweak these slightly – and obviously if these don't make sense for various reasons, I have zero pride of authorship.""
The partners discussed how to explain that Hunter was in the process of transitioning off the Burisma Holdings board after joining the Burisma Geothermal board earlier that year.
Two days later, Schwerin sent an email to Hunter and Wade discussing how they should respond to questions about ""whether there is a conflict of interest with Hunter's role on the Board vis a vis the VP's policy.""
Part of their drafted statement read, ""Hunter welcomes the scrutiny towards Burisma and its shareholders and is confident that they have operated in accordance with Ukrainian law.""
HUNTER BIDEN GUSHED OVER 'EXTRAVAGANT' GIFTS FROM BURISMA EXEC WHO WAS FOCUS OF CORRUPTION PROBE
On Nov. 19, 2015, Schwerin emailed Hunter, Archer, Sebastian Momtazi, who also had a Burisma.com email address, and Joan Mayer about Wade's invoice ""for his work related to the Burisma article, etc.""
""I think he'll continue to work on that project as part of this invoice if it is required. Let me know what entity you think will pay for that,"" Schwerin said of Wade.
On Dec. 5, 2015, Wade was copied on emails between Vadim Pozharskyi, a top Burisma executive, and another consultant discussing ""draft answers"" to an inquiry by The New York Times.
Fast forwarding to the Biden administration, Fox News Digital reviewed White House visitor logs and learned that he has visited at least five times over the last couple years. Three of the events appear to be larger events, including the annual July 4th celebration. Two of the visits, June 4, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2021, show the point of contact for the visits was an aide to first lady Jill Biden. It is unclear who Wade was actually meeting during the visits.
Alexander, Wade, Hunter’s lawyer, the White House, and the Biden campaign did not respond to Fox News Digital’s requests for comment.
The revelations come after Fox News Digital previously reported that at least two of the Biden campaign's national co-chairs, Democratic Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester and Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., have past ties to the embattled first son, who is the subject of a federal investigation.
Fox News Digital also recently reported that Hunter Biden and his business partners with ties to Burisma attended a December 2015 holiday party hosted by the then-Vice President Biden just a few days after he returned from his famous trip to Ukraine, where he threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid if the country’s leaders did not fire their top prosecutor.
After Biden returned to Washington from his short trip to Ukraine, he hosted a holiday party at the vice president's Naval Observatory residence on Dec. 12, 2015, where Hunter and several of his business partners from his now-dissolved investment firm Rosemont Seneca Partners were also in attendance, records show.
According to White House visitor logs, Hunter visited the White House on Dec. 12, 2015, with Rosemont Seneca co-founder Devon Archer, Rosemont Seneca President Eric Schwerin, and Sebastian Momtazi, an associate who worked in Rosemont Seneca’s New York City office with Archer. Archer, who was also on the Burisma board with Hunter, and Momtazi both had Burisma.com email addresses, according to emails reviewed by Fox News Digital.
A couple months after the holiday party, Hunter Biden thanked a top Burisma Holdings executive for birthday gifts he described as ""far too extravagant,"" Fox News Digital previously reported.

""V- Thanks so much,"" Hunter wrote, referring to top Burisma executive Vadym Pozharskyi. ""Let Nikolay know how much I appreciate his friendship and loyalty. I truly believe in what we are doing and I'm proud to say I am a part of this organization. And I am so glad you and I are on the same team.""
""Finally- thank NZ for the beautiful birthday gifts it was far too extravagant but much appreciated,"" he added, referring to Burisma’s founder and its former president, Mykola Zlochevsky. ""Let's talk tomorrow or Saturday about the editorial- I have a few ideas I'd like to share.""

Kenneth Eugene Smith, the condemned inmate, would be the first to die this way if the execution proceeds as planned. Smith was convicted in the 1988 killing of a pastor's wife as part of a murder-for-hire scheme and has been imprisoned for decades in Alabama. He already survived a botched lethal injection in November 2022 — one of four in Alabama since 2018, which was the same year the state authorized the use of nitrogen hypoxia in the death chamber. It is among three states, along with Oklahoma and Mississippi, that technically permit the method as an alternative in the death chamber since lethal injections in recent years have become harder to get.

But no execution has ever actually been carried out in the U.S. using the method, and experts have repeatedly warned that nitrogen toxicity may cause the condemned person to suffer unnecessarily while at the same time threatening the health of others in the room.
What is nitrogen hypoxia?
Nitrogen hypoxia is a process where pure nitrogen gas, or nitrogen gas at concentrations high enough to be lethal, is inhaled to the point of causing asphyxiation. It is a relatively new alternative to more common forms of capital punishment, like lethal injection and electrocution, which are the two methods used most prevalently across the U.S., according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
The non-profit organization noted that ""lethal gas"" is authorized broadly as an execution method in seven states, including Alabama, Mississippi and Oklahoma, although only those three have specified the use of nitrogen for this purpose, and only Alabama has released a formal execution protocol for nitrogen hypoxia. The protocol was issued last August, and the version made available to the public is heavily redacted.
Breathing nitrogen through a mask could in theory cause a person to lose consciousness before oxygen deprivation leads to death, and Alabama officials have insisted that this is most likely how the scheduled execution will happen. But Smith's legal team, while seeking an injunction to halt the execution plans that was ultimately rejected, accused the state of using him as a ""test subject"" for a lethal experiment. And the United Nations' human rights office called on Alabama to stop the execution, noting there is ""no scientific evidence to prove"" that execution by nitrogen inhalation will not cause ""grave suffering.""
A group of U.N. consultants raised concerns about the execution several weeks ago, saying ""that nitrogen hypoxia would result in a painful and humiliating death."" Ravina Shamdasani, the spokesperson for Volker Türk, who is the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, later warned that execution by nitrogen asphyxiation ""could amount to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment under international human rights law.""
What do we know about inhaling nitrogen gas?
During the execution, officials said Smith will be strapped to a gurney chamber and forced to breathe nitrogen through a gas mask until his body is depleted entirely of oxygen and shuts down. Although it has never been used before inside the death chamber, the consequences of too much nitrogen inhalation — usually accidentally in industrial settings — are well-documented.
Nitrogen exists organically in the atmosphere, and actually composes around 75% of the air that humans and animals breathe every day. But the colorless and odorless gas is only safe to inhale when it is mixed with an appropriate concentration of oxygen; otherwise, breathing it in is toxic. Veterinarians have refused to use nitrogen asphyxiation to euthanize animals because of its ""distressing"" effects and potential risks to people around.
Commercially and industrially, pure nitrogen is used in products like fertilizer, nylon and various dyes, as well as explosives. Because nitrogen displaces oxygen, it is often used at chemical plants and manufacturing facilities to shield certain equipment from contaminants, including oxygen, which could damage the equipment or in some cases even pose fire hazards or cause explosions. Liquid nitrogen is also used in laboratories and medical settings, for flash-freezing and other purposes.
The U.S. Chemical Safety Board issued a series of bulletins in the early 2000s that reviewed cases of nitrogen asphyxiation over the previous decade, with the aim of raising awareness and relaying proper safety protocols to prevent such situations from happening. In one bulletin that references information from the Compressed Gas Association, the board notes that when enough nitrogen is introduced to deplete oxygen in the air to less than 10%, effects on the human body can be lethal, potentially causing ""inability to move, loss of consciousness, convulsions"" and death.
Even partial oxygen displacement can have serious consequences. Research has shown that when oxygen levels in the air are down to around 12.5%, humans can experience ""impaired respiration that may cause permanent heart damage"" along with nausea, vomiting and ""very poor judgment and coordination.""
How will the execution work?
The mask the state will place over Smith's face is a ""NIOSH-approved Type-C full facepiece supplied air respirator,"" which is a type of mask sometimes used by industrial workers to get life-saving oxygen, the Associated Press reported, citing a court filing related to the execution.
""After the nitrogen gas is introduced, it will be administered for (1) fifteen minutes or (2) five minutes following a flatline indication on the EKG, whichever is longer,"" reads a portion of Alabama's protocol for execution by nitrogen hypoxia.
Most redacted portions of the protocol are those involving how the gas system is stored, tested and set up. Some of the sections still accessible to the public do acknowledge the potential risks associated with having nitrogen tanks in the workplace and note that staff tasked with handling the lethal gas system will receive training. Departing from protocols for other forms of capital punishment, the state says any staff member involved in the execution in a non-essential role will be dismissed from the death chamber after the mask is fixed to the condemned inmate.
Alabama's protocol does not allow a spiritual advisor in the chamber ""unless they review and sign the spiritual adviser nitrogen hypoxia acknowledgment form"" ahead of time. That restriction formed the basis for a lawsuit filed by Rev. Jeffrey Hood, a spiritual adviser to death row inmates, challenging the use of nitrogen hypoxia in executions.
Hood told CBS News last month that the method prevents him from doing his job properly because agreeing to support a condemned person through this type of execution could potentially put his own health in danger. He also said the rule in and of itself goes against a Supreme Court decision in March 2022 that required states to allow spiritual advisers to be present with condemned inmates in their final moments.",www.cbsnews.com,"What is nitrogen hypoxia?

“I figured they would just cancel the flight after it kept getting delayed over and over, but they didn’t cancel it,” Stringer explained, according to the Daily Dot. “I asked if there were other options, but the only options would have me leaving the airport the next morning and I had to get home.”
Stringer posted a video to TikTok where he enjoyed the flight on the plane direct to Charlotte, North Carolina.
“When you buy every single ticket on the plane so you don’t have to deal with people,” Stringer jokingly wrote in the video. The man also asked one of the baggage handlers how many suitcases he had loaded onto the flight, to which the man put up one finger.

As voters head to the polls in New Hampshire for the first presidential primary of 2024, one of the most important issues in the state is the fentanyl crisis.
Jess Carter is out on the streets five days a week with the nonprofit Revive, helping people dealing with active drug addiction. She told CBS News accidental poisonings from fentanyl are something she sees all the time.
""We don't want to continue losing our friends, our family, our community members,"" she said. ""Especially when there's a simple answer to reversing it right here.""
That answer, according to Carter, is something called harm reduction. She said the method is effective because it meets drug users ""where they are."" Her view is shaped by her own experience as a former college athlete who struggled with addiction herself.
Revive, one of the longest-running recovery programs in New Hampshire, hands out things like clean syringes, fentanyl testing strips and other supplies to help keep those dealing with addiction alive and to help prevent infectious diseases.
""We are allowing people to make a better choice for themselves,"" Carter said when asked how she responds to critics who say these actions help people continue to abuse drugs. ""We're allowing people to believe in themselves when others might not believe in them. It's that first step that people can take.""
For people like Shawn, who said his drug problems began when he got divorced, the work Carter does with Revive can be lifesaving.
""I took this little tiny piece of what I thought was crack cocaine and I inhaled it and I, I went down,"" Shawn said. ""It took six Narcans for, uh, to get revived.""
""I feel that I could have that chance to die every single day,"" Shawn added. ""I could have died last week and I'm afraid for other people too.""
Nearly 110,000 people died from drug overdoses in the U.S. in 2022, with roughly one-third of those deaths being attributed to fentanyl, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The epidemic of overdoses is a topic presidential candidates have brought up in New Hampshire, with former President Trump taking aim at Mexican drug cartels while former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley pointed the finger at China.
While Carter agrees the flow of drugs needs to be stopped, she said the heart of the issue is trauma and mental health.",www.cbsnews.com,How the fentanyl crisis has impacted New Hampshire voters,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/new-hampshire-primary-fentanyl-crisis-revive/,2024-01-01_2024-01-31,Health

Student loan payments and interest are set to resume in a matter of weeks as a three-year moratorium on federal student loan repayment comes to an end. But as student loan borrowers prepare for the return to repayment, the Biden administration is rolling out new interest benefits that will impact millions.
Here’s the latest.
When Student Loan Payments Resume And Interest Starts Accruing Again
The student loan pause is set to expire at the end of August. President Biden signed legislation codifying the end of the payment pause, so unless there is a new national emergency distinct from the Covid-19 pandemic, he will not be able to extend the pause again.
Interest will start accruing again in September. Interest rates for most federal student loans are fixed at a rate set by Congress based on the date of the loan’s original disbursement, and do not change with market conditions. So for most borrowers, interest rates will return to the rates that were in effect when the student loan pause was initially implemented.
Loan servicers will generate billing notices in September. And the first student loan billing due dates will be in October, according to the Education Department.
Interest Should Not Capitalize When Student Loan Payments Resume
Historically, when federal student loan payments were paused during a forbearance, interest has still accrued. And when the forbearance ends, all of that accrued interest would be capitalized, meaning added on to the loan principal. Interest would then continue accruing on that inflated balance, accelerating balance growth over time.
But according to the Education Department, outstanding interest should not be capitalized after the student loan pause ends. “For most borrowers, unpaid interest will not capitalize during the payment pause and through six months after the payment pause ends,” according to published guidance.
The department has also “asked loan servicers to undo interest capitalization that has an effective date after March 13, 2020. Your loan servicer will reach out if they are reversing your capitalized interest.”
Biden’s New Student Loan Payment Plan Will Waive Excess Interest
Last month, the Biden administration unveiled a new Income-Driven Repayment plan. The Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, will be the most affordable IDR plan ever created, according to the Education Department. SAVE will result in lower monthly payments for millions of borrowers, as well as accelerated student loan forgiveness for some.
In addition, the SAVE plan will waive excess interest accrual for borrowers who enroll. Currently, there is no requirement that borrowers in an IDR plan cover their monthly interest accrual. That means in situations where a borrower’s monthly IDR plan is less than the amount of monthly interest accrual, their loan balance would increase over time, even while the borrower makes payments and keeps their account in good standing. This process of ongoing balance growth during repayment is called negative amortization.
The SAVE plan will eliminate negative amortization. This means that for borrowers whose monthly payments under the plan are less than the amount needed to cover monthly interest accrual, that excess interest accrual will get waived on a rolling basis. This does not stop all interest from accruing, unless a borrower’s monthly payment under SAVE is zero (which is possible for some lower-income borrowers). However, it will stop a borrower’s student loan balance from growing.
The SAVE plan will be phased in over the course of the next year. But according to the Education Department, the interest benefits of the plan will be available to borrowers when student loan payments resume. The SAVE plan is replacing the Revised Pay As You Earn plan, and borrowers already enrolled in REPAYE will be able to receive the interest benefits from the SAVE plan automatically, according to the department.
New Regulations Will Limit Future Student Loan Interest Capitalization
The Biden administration has also rolled out new rules that will limit instances of future interest capitalization. The new regulations, which went into effect as of July 1, will prohibit interest capitalization in the following cases:
When a student loan borrower first begins repayment;
After a forbearance ends;
When a borrower goes into default;
When changing repayment plans from the the Pay As You Earn (PAYE), Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE), or Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) plan to another plan;
When a borrower fails to receritfy for the PAYE, REPAYE, or ICR plan on time;
During periods of negative amortization in the ICR plan (which historically has required annual interest capitalization).
The new regulations won’t undue any previous interest capitalization that already occurred. But as of July 1, they will prevent interest capitalization for these events going forward.

The warning covers vehicles from the 2000 through 2006 that previously had been recalled to replace faulty and dangerous air bag inflators made by Takata. The company used ammonium nitrate to inflate the air bags in a crash. But the chemical can deteriorate over time when exposed to heat and can blow apart a metal canister, hurling shrapnel that can injure or kill drivers and passengers.
Models involved in the recall include the 2000 through 2006 3 Series, the 2000 through 2003 5 Series and the 2000 through 2004 X5. All have driver's front air bag inflators made by Takata.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said drivers should park their vehicles and contact BMW for more information. Repairs are available at no cost to owners, as well as mobile repair and free towing.
Owners can go to BMW's website to check if their vehicle is affected or call BMW customer relations at (866) 835-8615. NHTSA also has a recall lookup tool on its website.
""Risk to vehicle occupants is dire""
""These vehicles are 17 to 22 years old, and the risk to vehicle occupants is dire,"" NHTSA said in a statement Thursday. ""These are some of the oldest Takata air bags under recall and have an extremely high probability of failure during a crash.""
Since 2009, the exploding air bags made by Takata have killed at least 33 people worldwide, including 24 in the United States. About 400 air bag injuries have happened in the U.S.
The BMW recall comes a couple months after other automakers recalled their vehicles for the same Takata-produced air bags. Safety officials earlier this year told drivers of older Honda, Ford and Stellantis vehicles with Takata inflators not to drive them. Honda said it has already replaced 99% of the dangerous inflators.
""These inflators are two decades old now, and they pose a 50% chance of rupturing in even a minor crash,"" NHTSA Acting Administrator Ann Carlson said in February. ""Don't gamble with your life or the life of someone you love — schedule your free repair today before it's too late.""
Potential for the dangerous malfunction led to the largest series of auto recalls in U.S. history, with at least 67 million Takata inflators recalled. The U.S. government says that many have not been repaired. About 100 million inflators have been recalled worldwide. The exploding air bags pushed Takata Corp. of Japan into bankruptcy.",www.cbsnews.com,"BMW places do not drive label on 90,000 recalled vehicles",,,https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/bmw-airbag-recall-2023-takata-inflators/,2023-05-01_2023-05-31,Business

Two 6.3 magnitude earthquakes killed at least 15 and injured nearly 40 others in western Afghanistan on Saturday, said a spokesperson for the country's national disaster authority.
Mohammad Abdullah Jan said four villages in the Zenda Jan district in Herat province bore the brunt of the quakes and aftershocks. Dozens of houses have been damaged.
The United States Geological Survey reported the 6.3 magnitude tremblors. It said the epicenter was 40 kilometers (24.8 miles) northwest of Herat city. There was an aftershock with a 5.5 magnitude.

A map on the USGS website indicates seven earthquakes in the area. At least five powerful earthquakes struck the city around noon, Herat city resident Abdul Shakor Samadi said.
""All people are out of their homes,"" Samadi said. ""Houses, offices and shops are all empty and there are fears of more earthquakes. My family and I were inside our home, I felt the quake."" His family began shouting and ran outside, afraid to return indoors.
The World Health Organization in Afghanistan said it dispatched 12 ambulance cars to Zenda Jan to evacuate casualties to hospitals.
""As deaths & casualties from the earthquake continue to be reported, teams are in hospitals assisting treatment of wounded & assessing additional needs,"" the U.N. agency said on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""WHO-supported ambulances are transporting those affected, most of them women and children.""
Telephone connections went down in Herat, making it hard to get details from affected areas. Videos on social media showed hundreds of people in the streets outside their homes and offices in Herat city.
Herat province borders Iran. The quake also was felt in the nearby Afghan provinces of Farah and Badghis, according to local media reports.
Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban-appointed deputy prime minister for economic affairs, expressed his condolences to the dead and injured in Herat and Badghis.

Cashews sold by Walmart in 30 states and on their website have been recalled due to unknown milk and coconut allergens, according to a company statement posted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The company John B Sanfilippo & Son, Inc. issued a recall notice for Great Value Honey Roasted Cashews after a customer said they found coconut cashews in a container labeled honey cashews. An investigation found that a limited number of the honey cashew labels were applied to cans of coconut cashews, the company said in the statement. The cashews are packaged in an 8.25-ounce plastic can with a blue wrap-around label with the UPC 078742133348.
Out of fear that customers with a coconut or milk allergy could be affected, the company recalled the product, which was distributed through Walmart in 30 states, including Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Kentucky, Texas, Vermont and West Virginia. A full list of the states where the cashews were distributed can be found here.
Cashews were also distributed on Walmart's website.

Lawyers Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro had filed demands for a speedy trial, and the Fulton county superior court judge Scott McAfee had set their trial to begin on 23 October. Trump and other defendants had asked to be tried separately from Powell and Chesebro, with some saying they could not be ready by the late October trial date.
The Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, last month obtained an indictment against Trump and the 18 others, charging them under the state’s anti-racketeering law in their efforts to deny Democrat Joe Biden’s victory over the Republican incumbent.
Willis had been pushing to try all 19 defendants together, arguing that it would be more efficient and fairer. McAfee cited the tight timetable, among other issues, as a factor in his decision to separate Trump and 16 others from Powell and Chesebro.
“The precarious ability of the court to safeguard each defendant’s due process rights and ensure adequate pre-trial preparation on the current accelerated track weighs heavily, if not decisively, in favor of severance,” McAfee wrote. He added that it might be necessary to further divide them into smaller groups for trial.
The development is likely to be welcome news to other defendants looking to avoid being tied by prosecutors to Powell, who perhaps more than anyone else in the Trump camp was vocal about publicly pushing baseless conspiracy theories linking foreign governments to election interferences.
Another defendant in the Atlanta case, Rudy Giuliani, has sought to distance himself from Powell and spoke at length about her in an interview with special counsel Jack Smith’s team in Washington, according to a person familiar with his account who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.
Also, Trump-aligned lawyer Eric Herschmann, who in 2020 tried to push back against efforts to undo the election, told the congressional committee investigating the riot at the US Capitol on January 6 that he regarded Powell’s ideas as “nuts”.
Chesebro and Powell had sought to be tried separately from each other, but the judge denied that request.
Chesebro is accused of working on the coordination and execution of a plan to have 16 Georgia Republicans sign a certificate declaring falsely that Trump won and declaring themselves the state’s “duly elected and qualified” electors. Powell is accused of participating in a breach of election equipment in rural Coffee county.
The nearly 100-page indictment details dozens of alleged acts by Trump or his allies to undo his 2020 loss in Georgia, including suggesting the secretary of state, a Republican, could help find enough votes for Trump to win the battleground state; harassing an election worker who faced false claims of fraud; and attempting to persuade Georgia lawmakers to ignore the will of voters and appoint a new slate of electoral college electors favorable to Trump.
Further explaining his decision to separate the others from Powell and Chesebro, McAfee said he was skeptical of prosecutors’ arguments that trying all 19 defendants together would be more efficient. He noted that the Fulton county courthouse does not have a courtroom big enough to hold 19 defendants, their lawyers and others who would need to be present, and relocating to a bigger venue could raise security concerns.
Prosecutors also had argued that because each defendant is charged under the state’s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or Rico Act, the state plans to call the same witnesses and present the same evidence for any trial in the case. They told the judge last week that they expect any trial would take four months, not including jury selection.
But McAfee pointed out that each additional defendant increases the time needed for opening statements and closing arguments, cross-examination and evidentiary objections. “Thus, even if the state’s case remains identical in length, and the aggregate time invested by the court is increased, the burden on the jurors for each individual trial is lessened through shorter separate trials,” he wrote.
The judge also noted that to satisfy the demands by Powell and Chesebro for a speedy trial, he will try to have a jury seated by 3 November. “With each additional defendant involved in the voir dire process, an already Herculean task becomes more unlikely,” he wrote.
McAfee also pointed to the fact that five defendants are currently seeking to move their cases to federal court and litigation on that issue is ongoing. If they were to succeed midway through a trial in the state court, it is not clear what the impact would be, McAfee wrote.",www.theguardian.com,Georgia judge allows key pair be tried separately from Trump and 16 others,,,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/14/georgia-election-case-sidney-powell-kenneth-chesebro-trump,2023-09-01_2023-09-30,Politics

Getting stuck in traffic and hitting several red lights in a row isn't just frustrating and bad for stress levels, it's also bad for the environment. But one U.S. city is getting help from a tech giant and artificial intelligence to solve this problem.
Google's Juliet Rothenberg is on a mission to make traffic lights more efficient and less annoying.
""Shift a few seconds from here to there and that shift can have a big impact,"" she told CBS News.
Google's new Project Green Light system uses the company's vast maps database and AI to optimize traffic lights around the world. The system suggests changes and city engineers then decide if they want to implement them.
""We had one case where we moved four seconds from a north-south street to an east-west street for a particular time of day, so then that can help reduce some of that stop-and-go traffic,"" Laura Wojcicki, an engineer at Seattle's Department of Transportation, told CBS News.
She said a suggestion from Google's system can be implemented in about five minutes.
Seattle is the first city in the U.S. to try Project Green Light, but the program is being tested out at 70 intersections in 13 cities around the world, impacting 30 million car trips per month. Google claims the project could reduce stop-and-go traffic by up to 30%.
""It means a lot for drivers and it also means a lot for emissions,"" Wojcicki said.
Half of vehicle emissions at intersections come from cars accelerating after stopping, she said. Google believes it can reduce those emissions by 10% — a welcome reduction considering transportation is the number one source of planet-warming pollution in the U.S.
""Intersections are a really good leverage point for tackling climate,"" Wojcicki said.

Chipotle is looking to hire 19,000 additional employees for its approaching peak “burrito season,” the company announced Wednesday, as restaurants across the country struggle to fill open roles.
Chipotle says its busiest time of year—or “burrito season”—stretches from March to May. Getty Images
Key Facts
“Burrito season” runs from March to May and has historically been Chipotle’s busiest time, according to a company statement. The company typically sees its “highest volumes of sales” during the spring due to “seasonal factors” like weather, Erin Wolford, Chipotle’s vice president of external communications, told Forbes. Wolford said the 19,000 open jobs include both full- and part-time restaurant positions. Last year, the company launched a recruitment campaign for 15,000 new positions in anticipation for “burrito season.”
Big Number
110,000. That’s how many people currently work at Chipotle, the company says.
Key Background
As of December, the nationwide unemployment rate sat at a very low 3.7%, and many restaurants are struggling to recruit new employees. Despite layoffs from the Covid pandemic, jobs in the hospitality and service industries have largely returned to pre-coronavirus levels, and there were some 979,000 unfilled accommodation and food service jobs as of November. Bank of America’s 2024 outlook for the restaurant industry noted that labor will remain a challenge, but some businesses have adapted by raising wages and other recruitment efforts. Despite the shortages in the industry, some major companies in other sectors—such as Wayfair and Amazon—have cut thousands of jobs in layoffs during the first few weeks of the year.

The man told police that Spacey was a “very slippery, snaky, difficult person” who tried to reel him in with promises of introductions to Hollywood stars before abusing him.
In a police interview shown to jurors at Southwark crown court, the complainant said he was once driving the Oscar-winning actor to a party hosted by Elton John when Spacey grabbed his penis with such force that he almost crashed.
The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said Spacey’s behaviour was known at the Old Vic theatre where he was artistic director from 2003 to 2015.
The man said: “It used to be a laughing joke about what was going on there. It was known. It was little comments, if a new apprentice had come in from university – a good looking boy – people would say ‘you better be careful’. It was well known that he [Spacey] was up to no good.”
Spacey wore a grey suit, light blue shirt and a red tie as he appeared in the dock on Monday, the third day of his month-long trial.
He has previously denied 12 charges, including sexual assault and indecent assault, against four men in their 20s and 30s, between 2001 and 2013.
The former House of Cards star’s first accuser alleges that in the early 2000s Spacey regularly groped him before laughing at the man’s objections. Spacey’s behaviour is alleged to have escalated over time, leaving the man feeling sick, ashamed and embarrassed. The man claimed Spacey assaulted him “a good dozen times”.
The man described Spacey as “creepy” while referencing the actor’s turn as a serial killer in the film Seven, saying: “The character in that, he’s a bit like that, a bit creepy. Maybe not quite as bad.”
The man said he felt as if Spacey thought he could groom him and that he tried to blank out the abuse. He did not feel able to come forward to police until 2022, he said.
The man said: “[Spacey] was very generous as well. He’d give me and my girlfriend front row seats to premieres and dinner on him. That’s what they do, try to reel you in, ‘I’ll give them that and they won’t say anything.’”
He added that Spacey would flatter him and tell him he was going to introduce him to lots of A-list and Hollywood stars.
He said Spacey was “pretending to be friendly and nice” but was a “predator” who was “aggressive”.
The man said Spacey was “touchy-feely” with him within two to three weeks of meeting him, which made him feel uncomfortable. He said Spacey would also talk about his personal life, including his troubled childhood.
The man said: “He was almost right from the get-go grooming me to see if I might swing a little bit, if I was a little bit gay.”
He added: “He was a very mixed-up individual. He didn’t know if he was straight or gay and he was clearly gay.”
The man said there were “multiple occasions, up to 12 times, he assaulted me when I was with him, in his company. He grabbed me in private areas, and then tried to get my hands on him, just at different times, in the car, in lifts.
“Every time we became alone over the years, on multiple occasions, he would try and grope me, grab me, and make me feel very very uncomfortable.”
He said he could vividly remember the last alleged incident, which led to him cutting off ties with Spacey. He said he was driving the actor to a party hosted by Elton John when Spacey grabbed his genitals so hard that he almost crashed the car.
Describing the incident in which he was left “winded”, the man said: “He grabbed me so hard I almost came off the road. He grabbed me really hard and it really hurt. I pushed him against the door and said: ‘Don’t do that again or I will knock you out.’”
He said Spacey giggled in response and said: “That’s such a turn on to me.”
In cross-examination, Patrick Gibbs KC, defending Spacey, suggested the man was “excited” by the encounters. The man, who gave evidence from behind a curtain, replied: “It made me feel sick, very awkward. Distressing. Exciting? No. I’m a man’s man and I had a beautiful woman at home ... The opposite of exciting.”
Spacey denies 12 charges, which include seven of sexual assault, three of indecent assault, one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent, and one count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.
On Friday, Gibbs suggested to the jurors that the complainants were motivated by his client’s fame and fortune.

Printers don't last forever, and there are always newer and better models entering the market, so naturally, you're eventually going to want to get rid of your old ones.
However, many printers are now wireless, meaning they have to be connected to your Wi-Fi network to work properly.
This means that information like your password, network type, assigned IP address and more get stored on your printer, and that information doesn't just go away when you decide to throw away or sell your printer.
That's why Canon is warning anyone who uses their home, office, or large-format inkjet printers to follow these steps before getting rid of their printer. Here's what you should do first.
Canon warns customers of data retention issues in wireless printers
Canon specifically focused on its own wireless printers, and the company warned its customers that if a hacker obtains an old wireless Canon printer that has not had the previous owner's information wiped from it, the hacker can steal that data and use it for their gain.

Some of the Canon printer models that have already been affected by this unfortunate circumstance include the E, G, GX, iB, iP, MB, MG, MX, PRO, TR, TS, and XK series. Canon also published its own document listing every model that has experienced data retention issues, so customers can easily check if their model has been affected.
What should I do before getting rid of my old printer?
If you specifically have an old Canon printer that you're looking to get rid of, Canon also announced the process you can follow for wiping all your data from the printer, depending on what model you have. These are the instructions that the company provided:

A Telegram channel used by more than 3,000 teachers for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza was found replete with posts celebrating Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel, praising the terrorists who raped and murdered civilians as ""heroes.""
The Telegram channel is intended for UNRWA teachers and contains files with staff names, ID numbers, schedules, and curriculum materials, according to UN Watch, which highlighted the troubling messages in a Wednesday report.
Users on the channel glorified the ""education"" the terrorists received, shared photos of dead or captured Israelis and urged the execution of hostages – in some cases, minutes after the attack began.
Users also regularly share videos, photos, and messages inciting ""Jihadi terrorism"" and openly celebrate the massacre and rape of civilians by Hamas terrorists, the report alleged.

In one post highlighted in the report, UNRWA teacher Waseem Ula shared a video glorifying the Hamas attacks and posted a photo of a suicide bomb vest wired with explosives.
The caption read: ""Wait, sons of Judaism.""
He was also alleged to have glorified one of the perpetrators of the Oct. 7 attack as a ""friend"" and ""brother"" whom he prayed to Allah to ""admit him to paradise without judgment.""
""This is the motherlode of UNRWA teachers’ incitement to Jihadi terrorism,"" said Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch, the Geneva-based organization that monitors the UN.
Fox News Digital has reached out to UNRWA for a response to UN Watch’s report.
This is not the first time troubling reports regarding the UNRWA have emerged since the Oct. 7 attack.

The U.K.-based Institute for Monitoring Peace and Cultural Tolerance in School Education (IMPACT-se) issued a 123-page report in November accusing UNRWA teachers of having ""publicly celebrated the October 7 massacre and other Hamas attacks on their social media accounts.""
The Trump administration cut ties with UNRWA in 2018, with the State Department calling the organization an ""irredeemably flawed operation.""
However, President Biden reestablished the relationship in June 2021, pumping an estimated $1 billion of taxpayer money into the organization since then.
Hamas terrorists killed 1,200 people – mostly civilians – and took 240 hostages when it stormed into Israel’s borders on Oct. 7. In the weeks since then, Israel has waged an all-out assault on Gaza with the express aim of destroying the terrorist group’s military capabilities.

Hurricane Lee is quickly regaining strength in the Atlantic after a brief weakening trend.
As of 5 p.m. Sunday, the storm had reobtained Category 3 strength and showed signs of further strengthening based on its satellite presentation.
Lee felt the impacts of wind shear over the past couple of days, causing the storm to temporarily weaken to a Category 2.
""Lee"" will create coastal concerns middle of this week through next weekend along Maryland & Delaware Atlantic Ocean beaches. Primary concern is dangerous rip currents, large swells & waves generated by ""Lee"" offshore. Storm will become huge in size, so impacts last for awhile. pic.twitter.com/gUtHGjQOlB — Steven Sosna (@SteveSosnaWX) September 11, 2023
All of our forecast computer models strongly agree and keep Lee safely offshore. This outcome gives our weather team high confidence the storm will not pose any direct landfall threat to Maryland and/or Delaware.
While Lee will be weakening as it moves to our east, the wind field will be expanding in size as the storm becomes larger.
The hurricane will transition into a nor'easter-like storm by late this week or next weekend as it moves across colder ocean waters.
This will mean the wind intensity will continue to weaken, but the wind field will expand. Tropical storm force winds and rain bands may expand outward several hundred miles from the storm's center.
Despite an even larger storm in size, we're still confident its direct impacts stay to our east.
Here's why: A piece of energy, in the upper levels of the atmosphere, pivoting over us Friday will help nudge Lee to our east.
The timing and potency of this piece of energy are important since Lee will directly respond to these factors.
Right now, these two players are more important for eastern New England and Canada as Lee tracks closer to their shorelines.
""Lee"" forecast path trends continue to be good for us in Maryland.

More uncertainty exists w/ storm track in eastern New England/Canada. pic.twitter.com/wOdj7lAtKx — Steven Sosna (@SteveSosnaWX) September 11, 2023
Our Atlantic Ocean beaches in Maryland and Delaware will still take a sizable hit from some of the indirect impacts of Lee.
Since the storm will become so massive in size, it will generate large swells and waves that travel far away from its center. These larger swells are expected to arrive as early as Tuesday along our Maryland and Delaware beaches. Wave heights ranging from 6 to 8 feet are possible by late this week into next weekend.
The increasing wave heights and larger swells will generate dangerous rip currents along our Atlantic Ocean beaches. Their arrival looks as early as Tuesday.
Since Lee will be tracking parallel to our shoreline this week, rip currents and large waves will be a major concern into next weekend. Swimming is not advised during this time and you should only visit beaches with lifeguards on duty.
We continue to closely monitor path of ""Lee"" for any adjustments or changes. Most of the state should feel nothing. ""Lee"" impacts should be limited to Atlantic Ocean beaches. This is a high confidence forecast, but it's still a good idea to check for updates throughout the week. pic.twitter.com/owmT58xWU8 — Steven Sosna (@SteveSosnaWX) September 11, 2023
While Lee currently does not pose a direct landfall threat to us, it's still a good idea to routinely check the forecast this week.

Webb's singular ability to observe the universe in different wavelengths of infrared light, such as near-infrared and mid-infrared, showcases the stars, gas and dust within the intricate structure of each galaxy.
The Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore is the mission operations center for the telescope. It launched last in 2021 from French Guiana.
Astronomers believe that about 60% of all galaxies are spiral galaxies - and our solar system resides in one of the spiral arms of the Milky Way galaxy. Webb's observations can help astronomers better understand star formation and the evolution of spiral galaxies like our own.
Seen face-on, each galaxy in the new images has spiral arms laden with stars. The center of each galaxy features clusters of old stars or supermassive black holes.
The observations were made as part of the PHANGS, or the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS, project. More than 100 astronomers around the world participate in the program, which also looks at data from the Hubble Space Telescope, the European Space Observatory's Very Large Telescope's MUSE instrument and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Chile.
Data from the different telescopes enables astronomers to make observations across different wavelengths of visible, ultraviolet and radio light. Adding Webb's infrared insights can help address some of the observational gaps.
""Webb's new images are extraordinary,"" said Janice Lee, PHANGS core member and a project scientist for new missions and strategic initiatives at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, in a statement. ""They're mind-blowing even for researchers who have studied these same galaxies for decades. Bubbles and filaments are resolved down to the smallest scales ever observed, and tell a story about the star formation cycle.""

Peering inside the spirals
Astronomers used Webb's Near-Infrared Camera to observe millions of stars, seen in sparkling blue, grouped together in clusters and spread throughout the arms of the 19 galaxies as well. Meanwhile, Webb's Mid-Infrared Instrument puts the spotlight on glowing dust surrounding the stars, as well as red still-forming stars cocooned in the very gas and dust that aids stellar growth.
""These are where we can find the newest, most massive stars in the galaxies,"" said Erik Rosolowsky, PHANGS core member and a professor of physics at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, in a statement.
The spiral arms are practically incandescent with orange and red gas in Webb's imagery. The images will be used to help astronomers determine the distribution of gas and dust in spiral galaxies, as well as how galaxies both nurture and cease the formation of stars.
""These structures tend to follow the same pattern in certain parts of the galaxies,"" Rosolowsky said. ""We think of these like waves, and their spacing tells us a lot about how a galaxy distributes its gas and dust.""
Webb also captured large, spherical shell-shaped voids among the galactic gas and dust that were likely sculpted by the explosions of stars.
""These holes may have been created by one or more stars that exploded, carving out giant holes in the interstellar material,"" said Adam Leroy, PHANGS core member and a professor of astronomy at the Ohio State University in Columbus, in a statement.
The anatomy of a galaxy
Astronomers think that galaxies form from the inside out. Star formation begins at the galactic center before rippling across the arms in a spiral. That means a star's distance from the heart of the galaxy is relative to its age, so younger stars are likely farther from the galactic core. Groupings of blue stars near the centers of each galaxy indicate older stars.
Meanwhile, some galaxies have pinkish-red spikes near their centers.
""That's a clear sign that there may be an active supermassive black hole,"" said Eva Schinnerer, PHANGS core member and a staff scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, in a statement. ""Or, the star clusters toward the center are so bright that they have saturated that area of the image.""
Scientists are most excited about studying the massive number of stars revealed by Webb's new images, according to Leroy.
""Stars can live for billions or trillions of years,"" Leroy said. ""By precisely cataloging all types of stars, we can build a more reliable, holistic view of their life cycles.""

""I think at the end of the day, we both want the most fair admissions policy possible,"" said Joseph Hernandez, a second-year student from California who supports affirmative action. ""I think we can both agree that income needs to be taken into account as a factor.""

Alma Conway, a third-year student from Arizona who opposes affirmative action, agreed.
RACE-BASED ADMISSIONS? TWO HARVARD STUDENTS DEBATE AHEAD OF SUPREME COURT DECISION
""I do think factoring income is kind of worth considering,"" Conway said. ""Maybe it should be taken into consideration to an extent, but just to what extent is that?""
The Supreme Court this week is expected to rule on two cases that could determine the fate of affirmative action in college admissions after a 40-year precedent.
WATCH TWO HARVARD STUDENTS DETAIL ARGUMENTS OVER RACE-BASED ADMISSIONS:
""I think that if the court decides to remove it, it will be a step in the right direction,"" Conway said. ""Maybe the benefits won't be seen immediately because there will be protests and students will be upset, but hopefully in the long run it's looking at race less, which I think should be the goal.""
But Hernandez felt race is ""a factor that determines people's opportunity and as such should be taken into account when we look at admissions.""
In one case, Students for Fair Admissions argued that Harvard discriminated against Asian American students by holding them to higher admissions standards in academics than other racial groups, violating the Civil Rights Act. In the other, the same student group alleged that the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill used race as a primary factor in admissions to favor Black, Hispanic and Native American applicants and accused the college of violating the 14th Amendment.
Both colleges said race was just one of many factors used in their admissions processes and denied breaking any laws.
""I hope that even if anyone disagrees with me on the subject of race in admissions, they're really thinking about how can we make admissions as fair as possible,"" Hernandez said. ""There are some very clear issues in admissions, regardless of where you stand on affirmative action.""
Legal experts previously told Fox News the Supreme Court conservative majority seemed likely to ban affirmative action in college admissions based on their comments during October's oral arguments. Yet 63% of adults said the court shouldn't ban colleges from considering race or ethnicity, an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found in May.
RACE-BASED COLLEGE ADMISSIONS? HARVARD STUDENTS WEIGH IN AS SCOTUS CONSIDERS FATE OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
""If the decision ultimately overturns affirmative action, accounting for socioeconomic status but not race will likely be the best option we'll have left — but that doesn't make it a fair admissions system,"" Hernandez told Fox News. ""We can find common ground in the common goal of fair admissions. Where we disagree is what that looks like.""
Conway said ""both sides are well-intentioned.""
""One wants previously underrepresented communities to now shine and others want representation on basis of merit, not solely selecting or promoting on basis of race,"" she said.
Critics have argued that affirmative action encourages discrimination and prioritizes race over merit. But supporters, including many colleges, have said racial diversity benefits all students and that affirmative action has helped offer more opportunities to minority students who have less access to educational advantages like tutors.
""There are some other aspects that I think we may not always agree on, but I think that at the end of the day, we want the whole picture of the person,"" Hernandez said. ""There are many things about that that make up what a person is.""

Conway agreed that there are many factors that show who a student is that are worth keeping as considerations in college admissions, including extracurricular activities, leadership roles and prior jobs. The two Harvard students were firm on their affirmative action positions, but agreed there was room for civil discussion on other ways to ensure a fair admissions process.
""If you can agree with someone on a lot of stuff, they're a friend more than a foe,"" Conway said.

TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s space agency said early Saturday that its spacecraft is on the moon, but is still “checking its status.” More details will be given at a news conference, officials said.
The Smart Lander for Investigating Moon, or SLIM, came down onto the lunar surface at around 12:20 a.m. Tokyo time Saturday (1520 GMT Friday). No astronauts were onboard the spacecraft.

If SLIM landed successfully, Japan would become the fifth country to accomplish the feat after the United States, the Soviet Union, China and India.
As the spacecraft descended, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s mission control said that everything was going as planned and later said that SLIM was on the lunar surface. But there was no mention of whether the landing was successful.
Mission control kept repeating that it was “checking its status” and that more information would be given at a news conference. It wasn’t immediately clear when the news conference would start.

SLIM, nicknamed “the Moon Sniper,” started its descent at midnight Saturday, and within 15 minutes it was down to about 10 kilometers (six miles) above the lunar surface, according to the space agency, which is known as JAXA.
At an altitude of five kilometers (three miles), the lander was in a vertical descent mode, then at 50 meters (165 feet) above the surface, SLIM was supposed to make a parallel movement to find a safe landing spot, JAXA said.
About a half-hour after its presumed landing, JAXA said that it was still checking the status of the lander.
SLIM, which was aiming to hit a very small target, is a lightweight spacecraft about the size of a passenger vehicle. It was using “pinpoint landing” technology that promises far greater control than any previous moon landing.
While most previous probes have used landing zones about 10 kilometers (six miles) wide, SLIM was aiming at a target of just 100 meters (330 feet).

The project was the fruit of two decades of work on precision technology by JAXA.
The mission’s main goal is to test new landing technology that would allow moon missions to land “where we want to, rather than where it is easy to land,” JAXA has said. If the landing was a success, the spacecraft will seek clues about the origin of the moon, including analyzing minerals with a special camera.

The SLIM, equipped with a pad to cushion impact, was aiming to land near the Shioli crater, near a region covered in volcanic rock.
The closely watched mission came only 10 days after a moon mission by a U.S. private company failed when the spacecraft developed a fuel leak hours after the launch.
SLIM was launched on a Mitsubishi Heavy H2A rocket in September. It initially orbited Earth and entered lunar orbit on Dec. 25.

Japan hopes a success will help regain confidence for its space technology after a number of failures. A spacecraft designed by a Japanese company crashed during a lunar landing attempt in April, and a new flagship rocket failed its debut launch in March.
JAXA has a track record with difficult landings. Its Hayabusa2 spacecraft, launched in 2014, touched down twice on the 900-meter-long (3,000-foot-long) asteroid Ryugu, collecting samples that were returned to Earth.
Experts say a success of SLIM’s pinpoint landing, especially on the moon, would raise Japan’s profile in the global space technology race.
Takeshi Tsuchiya, aeronautics professor at the Graduate School of Engineering at the University of Tokyo, said it was important to confirm the accuracy of landing on a targeted area for the future of moon explorations.
“It is necessary to show the world that Japan has the appropriate technology in order to be able to properly assert Japan’s position in lunar development,” he said. The moon is important from the perspective of explorations of resources, and it can also be used as a base to go to other planets, like Mars, he said.

SLIM is carrying two small autonomous probes — lunar excursion vehicles LEV-1 and LEV-2, which will be released just before landing.
LEV-1, equipped with an antenna and a camera, is tasked with recording SLIM’s landing. LEV-2, is a ball-shaped rover equipped with two cameras, developed by JAXA together with Sony, toymaker Tomy and Doshisha University.
JAXA will broadcast a livestream of the landing, while space fans will gather to watch the historic moment on a big screen at the agency’s Sagamihara campus southwest of Tokyo.

As AI continues to advance at an exponential rate, businesses are realizing that traditional governance methods are struggling to keep up with the complexities of the modern digital economy.
The rise of the Chief AI Officer in the C-suite underscores this shift, buttressing the growing importance of AI in corporate leadership. However, this raises a critical question: Shouldn't this forward-looking approach also apply to the board of directors? With recent studies pointing out the urgent need for AI governance, it is clear that boards must not only adapt to but also proactively monitor the incorporation of AI into corporate strategy.
AI in the Boardroom
Although AI has the potential to enhance strategic decision making, discussions about its use and governance in the boardroom are still in the early stages.
Ryan McCarthy, Audit Partner and Board Leadership Centre Lead, KPMG Ireland, speaking on the role of AI in the boardroom, observed that conversations around AI often revolve around perceived threats rather than opportunities, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of AI’s value. In his words, “we’re not seeing AI discussed around board tables in a meaningful way yet. When it does get discussed, it’s with the level of depth of discussing any new potential game changer – at the start you’re only scratching the surface.”
AI offers a number of opportunities for the board. A 2021 study examining the importance of law and regulation in the adoption of AI in corporate boardrooms, explains that AI could help companies make better decisions focusing on ESG goals while reducing the risks associated with subjective decision-making such as being influenced by short-term thinking and opportunistic behaviour.
For example, if a company’s board needs to make a decision about whether or not to invest in a new project, without AI, they may have to rely on limited data and subjective interpretations of such data. Whereas AI could be used to analyze market data and financial statements, providing a more comprehensive picture of the risks and impacts of the proposed project. Thus helping the board to make informed decisions that better align with the company’s ESG goals.
AI also holds promise in optimizing board meetings and deliberations by automating routine tasks like scheduling meetings, providing summaries of pre-reads and taking notes. This allows board members to focus more on having in-depth discussions.
AI Governance Beyond the C-Suite
The role of Chief AI Officer is the new kid on the block in the C-suite. Several companies, including Accenture Federal Services, Boeing, eBay, Dell Technologies, and the Mayo Clinic, have already established this position. The Chief AI Officer is responsible for overseeing governance, driving innovation, and enhancing productivity through AI. Their duties include crafting AI strategies, nurturing AI talent, and advocating for ethical and responsible AI practices while ensuring effective communication with senior management and other stakeholders, among other things.
Given the critical importance of this role today, an important question arises: shouldn’t there also be a corresponding role on the board of directors to support and oversee the Chief AI Officer’s activities?
This question is crucial in light of a 2023 study conducted by the Institute of Directors which underscores the urgency for boards to prioritize AI governance, revealing widespread use of AI without corresponding oversight measures. According to the report, 80% of boards lack formal procedures to assess their company’s use of AI and 86% of businesses employ AI tools without the board’s awareness. The report consequently emphasized that AI needs to be included on board agendas and treated as a key corporate governance issue.
One practical way to address this issue, is to appoint a director with AI/tech expertise to the board, in addition to selecting a Chief AI Officer. Companies are beginning to see the value in this approach as evidenced by board recruiters who have observed a notable increase in the appointment of first-time board directors chosen for their expertise in AI or ESG.
Enter, Directors with AI/Tech Expertise
A March 2024 study by ISS-Corporate, analyzing proxy statements from September 2022 to September 2023 found that approximately 15% of S&P 500 companies disclosed details about board oversight of AI. This included responsibilities assigned to boards or committees, director expertise in AI, or the establishment of AI ethics boards. According to this study, around 13% of companies have directors with AI expertise.
What is the role of an AI/tech director? Working in concert with the Chief AI Officer and relevant board committees, an AI/tech director would be responsible for deploying AI strategically within the company, developing policies to ensure that the company’s use of AI complies with regulatory frameworks, evaluating and mitigating risks associated with AI technologies. They could also advocate for the use of AI technologies where doing so will improve efficiency, facilitate ongoing education and training for board members on AI trends, capabilities and challenges, etc.
Having established the valuable role an AI/tech director could play, what qualifications should such a director have? Board recruiters point out that boards are still trying to clarify what these qualifications should be. Scott Coleman, a Senior Client Partner at Korn Ferry explains, “boards are talking a lot about the need for AI expertise, but because it is so complicated, they are having trouble figuring out the skill sets and competencies their businesses need.”
The qualifications of an AI/tech director could however be similar to those required of a Chief AI Officer. Ideal candidates would possess technical expertise in AI and machine learning coupled with industry-specific experience. This includes a proven track record in senior leadership roles where they’ve successfully implemented data and AI strategies within corporate settings. Also, given that younger generations are more attuned to AI developments, it would be beneficial to have more young directors on boards.
Key skills include a deep understanding of ethical considerations in AI and commitment to promoting responsible AI practices, strong communication and collaboration skills, knowledge of corporate governance and regulatory frameworks, and commitment to fostering diversity and inclusion.
In all, as we venture further into the digital era, incorporating AI into the board agenda is not just an option but a necessity for forward-thinking companies. To make the most of AI’s capabilities, boards should embrace technological advancements while fostering an environment that prioritizes ethical considerations. Doing so requires the inclusion of skilled individuals both in the C-suite and on the board who can steer the company towards using AI as a tool for sustainable and responsible growth.",www.forbes.com,The Rise Of The Chief AI Officer: Is A Board Equivalent Necessary?,,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/oludolapomakinde/2024/04/23/the-rise-of-the-chief-ai-officer-is-a-board-equivalent-necessary/,2024-04-01_2024-04-30,Technology

The White House said Friday that it has secured voluntary commitments from seven U.S. companies meant to ensure their AI products are safe before they release them. Some of the commitments call for third-party oversight of the workings of commercial AI systems, though they don’t detail who will audit the technology or hold the companies accountable.
A surge of commercial investment in generative AI tools that can write convincingly human-like text and churn out new images and other media has brought public fascination as well as concern about their ability to trick people and spread disinformation, among other dangers.
The four tech giants, along with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and startups Anthropic and Inflection, have committed to security testing “carried out in part by independent experts” to guard against major risks, such as to biosecurity and cybersecurity, the White House said in a statement.
The companies have also committed to methods for reporting vulnerabilities to their systems and to using digital watermarking to help distinguish between real and AI-generated images known as deepfakes.
They will also publicly report flaws and risks in their technology, including effects on fairness and bias, the White House said.
The voluntary commitments are meant to be an immediate way of addressing risks ahead of a longer-term push to get Congress to pass laws regulating the technology.
Some advocates for AI regulations said Biden’s move is a start but more needs to be done to hold the companies and their products accountable.
“History would indicate that many tech companies do not actually walk the walk on a voluntary pledge to act responsibly and support strong regulations,” said a statement from James Steyer, founder and CEO of the nonprofit Common Sense Media.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has said he will introduce legislation to regulate AI. He has held a number of briefings with government officials to educate senators about an issue that’s attracted bipartisan interest.
A number of technology executives have called for regulation, and several went to the White House in May to speak with Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and other officials.
But some experts and upstart competitors worry that the type of regulation being floated could be a boon for deep-pocketed first-movers led by OpenAI, Google and Microsoft as smaller players are elbowed out by the high cost of making their AI systems known as large language models adhere to regulatory strictures.
The software trade group BSA, which includes Microsoft as a member, said Friday that it welcomed the Biden administration’s efforts to set rules for high-risk AI systems.
“Enterprise software companies look forward to working with the administration and Congress to enact legislation that addresses the risks associated with artificial intelligence and promote its benefits,” the group said in a statement.
A number of countries have been looking at ways to regulate AI, including European Union lawmakers who have been negotiating sweeping AI rules for the 27-nation bloc.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recently said the United Nations is “the ideal place” to adopt global standards and appointed a board that will report back on options for global AI governance by the end of the year.
The United Nations chief also said he welcomed calls from some countries for the creation of a new U.N. body to support global efforts to govern AI, inspired by such models as the International Atomic Energy Agency or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
The White House said Friday that it has already consulted on the voluntary commitments with a number of countries.",apnews.com,"Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and other tech firms agree to AI safeguards set by the White House",,,https://apnews.com/article/artificial-intelligence-safeguards-joe-biden-kamala-harris-4caf02b94275429f764b06840897436c,2023-07-01_2023-07-31,Technology

A real bad day.
Jones' three-turnover afternoon in New England's 38-3 loss to the Cowboys was his worst game as a pro, and led to Bill Belichick's worst loss in his storied NFL career. The defeat dropped the Patriots to 1-3 on the season and has cast some serious doubt on Jones' abilities to be New England's quarterback of the future.
It's a lot for anyone to deal with, but Belichick seems confident that his third-year QB will shake it off and bounce back Sunday against New Orleans.
""Anybody who plays or coaches in this league has not so good performances somewhere along the line. So, part of the job, part of the situation, every week's a new week,"" Belichick said Friday as New England prepares to host the 2-2 Saints this weekend.
""Mac's pretty mentally tough,"" Belichick added. ""So is everybody else around here. I mean, you have to be in this league. If it just goes from bad to worse, then you're not going to be around very long. We all get knocked down, got to get up and go back in the ring.""
Jones was in his own head last weekend, running around like a madman and making errant throws for three quarters before getting benched for Bailey Zappe. While the New England offensive line hasn't been great, Jones was a little too eager to run out of the pocket instead of waiting for plays to develop. That led to a strip-sack fumble by the Cowboys, which the Dallas defense returned for a touchdown.
Jones' uneasiness also led to him forcing back-foot throws that didn't need to be forced for much of his afternoon. His cross-field pass just before halftime was returned for a pick-six by Dallas.
The quarterback spent the week dusting himself off and learning from his Week 4 mistakes as he gets set to step back into the ring against a middling New Orleans defense. Jones expressed confidence in himself to have a good bounce-back performance when he spoke to reporters earlier this week.
""Confidence is something that comes from years of practice and it grows over time. I think that's what I have to look back on, is I've played well at times and I just have got to be more consistent,"" he said. ""I know it's there.""
Jones now has 10 games with multiple turnovers over his career -- regular season and postseason -- and is 5-3 in the games following those performances. (Two of those multi-turnover games ended New England's season: In the 2021 Wild Card round loss in Buffalo, and in Week 17 at Miami in 2022. He has a trio of three-interception games on his resume, with his first coming against the Saints in Week 3 of his rookie season.
The pressure is on for Jones to not just play well, but to also play a major part of a New England victory this weekend. If not, it will only get harder for the quarterback to get up and get back into the ring.

(AP) — Adnan Syed will not return to jail and his murder conviction is on hold, for now, as Maryland's Supreme Court decides whether to hear his appeal.
The state's highest court issued an order on Thursday that prevents the reinstatement of Syed's murder conviction by a lower court.
Syed's legal case began more than two decades ago, and gained international attention from the hit podcast ""Serial."" He regained his freedom in September from a judge after Baltimore prosecutors moved to vacate his conviction, saying they reviewed the case and found alternative suspects as well as unreliable evidence used at trial.
But the victim's family said they received insufficient notice to attend the September hearing before the judge in person, which violated their right to be ""treated with dignity and respect,"" and the state's intermediate appellate court agreed. In a 2-1 decision in March that was stayed for 60 days, the judges reinstated Syed's conviction and ordered a redo of the hearing in question.
With the 60 days nearing an end, Syed's lawyer, Erica Suter, asked the Supreme Court of Maryland on Wednesday to issue a stay in the case to prevent her client from potentially being incarcerated while the court considers whether to hear an appeal.
Justice Shirley Watts noted in her order, which was approved with a majority of the court's seven justices, that the victim's family and the office of the state's attorney general have consented to the stay of the lower court's mandate while the Supreme Court considers whether to hear the appeal and during the pendency of an appeal.
Suter is asking the court to review several legal issues, including whether former Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby's decision to dismiss the charges against Syed last year made the family's court challenge moot.
Syed, who has always maintained his innocence, was 17 when his high school ex-girlfriend and classmate, Hae Min Lee, was found strangled to death and buried in a makeshift grave in 1999. He was arrested weeks later and ultimately convicted of murder in 2000.
In Wednesday's court filing, Syed's counsel noted he has been employed since December, working as a Program Associate at Georgetown University's Prisons and Justice Initiative.
The filing also noted that Syed has been caring for his elderly parents. His father suffers from dementia and his mother has been diagnosed with leukemia.
""Mr. Syed's return has meant a better quality of life for his loved ones as he is able to assist with the day-to-day management of his parents' health, transport them to doctor's appointments, and generally be of service to them,"" the court filing said.",www.cbsnews.com,"Adnan Syed's murder conviction on hold for now, as Maryland Supreme Court considers appeal",,,https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/adnan-syeds-murder-conviction-on-hold-for-now-as-maryland-supreme-court-considers-appeal/,2023-05-01_2023-05-31,Law

“I can’t come up with Plan B is while still working with Plan A,” the comedian told NPR, noting he doesn’t want to continue as one of the show’s cadre of correspondents while someone else is being considered for the top role. “The job of correspondent…it’s not really one where you can juggle multiple things. [And] I think eight years is a good run,” he said.
His exit spotlights complications at the venerable program as Comedy Central broadens its search for a new lead figure. Noah abruptly announced his exit in late 2022 in front of a live audience that had come to see a the taping of a new episode. Comedy Central has relied on guest hosts ever since — until the show had to go dark due to the Hollywood writers strike.
The Paramount Global network had settled on Hasan Minhaj — who had guest hosted along with candidates such as Chelsea Handler, Marlon Wayans, Kal Penn and Sarah Silverman — as a leading candidate for the job, but then appears to have reversed its decision after a New Yorker report described ways in which Minhaj had embellished some of his autobiographical comedy routines.
“Daily Show” has been through similar tumult in the past. When Jon Stewart neared the end of his tenure at the series, several correspondents began to consider outside offers. John Oliver, who had filled in for Stewart during an absence from “Daily,” moved to HBO to launch “Last Week Tonight.” And longtime correspondent Samantha Bee jumped to launch her own series at Warner Bros. Discovery’s TBS.
“Daily Show” is expected to return to original production on October 16, with guest hosts slated to lead the series for the rest of the year. Executives expect to have identify a new host in the interim and have that person in place by 2024.
“Roy Wood Jr is a comedic genius and beloved teammate. His insights and hilarity helped us make sense of the 2016 election, the pandemic, and countless hours of Fox News,” Comedy Central said in a statement. “We thank him for his time with us and can’t wait to see what he does next.”

(AP) — Lawyers for two of Aretha Franklin’s sons urged a Michigan jury Tuesday to declare a 2014 document as the music superstar’s valid will, saying there’s nothing legally significant about finding the handwritten papers in a notebook in her couch.
It’s “inconsequential. ... You can take your will and leave it on the kitchen counter. It’s still your will,” Charles McKelvie said in closing arguments in a suburban Detroit court before the jury began deliberations.
Another lawyer, Craig Smith, pointed to the first line of the document, which was displayed on four large posters in front of the jury.
“Says right here: ‘This is my will.’ She’s speaking from the grave, folks,” Smith said of Franklin.
Franklin, known as the Queen of Soul, did not leave behind a formal, typewritten will when she died five years ago at age 76. But two documents, with scribbles and hard-to-decipher passages, emerged in 2019 when a niece was scouring the home for records.
Franklin’s estate managers have been paying bills, settling millions in tax debts and generating income through music royalties and other intellectual property. The will dispute, however, has been unfinished business.
One will, dated 2010, was locked in a cabinet. Another, dated four years later, was found around the time same in the living room under cushions. The issue for the jury: Is the 2014 version valid under Michigan law? If so, it could trump the 2010 version.
There are differences between the competing documents, though they both appear to indicate Franklin’s four sons would share income from music and copyrights.
But under the 2014 will, Kecalf Franklin and grandchildren would get his mother’s main home in Bloomfield Hills, which was valued at $1.1 million when she died but is worth much more today.
“The crown jewel,” Smith told jurors.
The older will said Kecalf, 53, and Edward Franklin, 64, “must take business classes and get a certificate or a degree” to benefit from the estate. That provision is not in the 2014 version.
Kecalf and Edward have teamed up against brother Ted White II, who favors the 2010 will.
“Teddy wants to disinherit his two brothers. Teddy wants it all,” Smith told the jury in the sharpest remark during final arguments.
White’s attorney, Kurt Olson, noted the 2010 will was under lock and key. He said it’s much more significant than papers found in a couch.
“They’re trying to make Ted a bad guy,” said Olson, who argued that Franklin’s signature was not in a proper place to make the 2014 document valid.
Franklin was a global star for decades, known for hits like “Think,” “I Say a Little Prayer” and “Respect.”

CDOT
Both Interstate 70 and Interstate 76 were closed for parts of Tuesday and Wednesday in the eastern part of the state due to the wintry conditions that came with the blizzard, which also affected several other states including Colorado's neighbors to the east Kansas and Nebraska. Smaller highways were also affected, and it has taken a lot of work to get them safe for drivers again.
CDOT
On Friday the Colorado Department of Transportation shared photos of heavy equipment that was brought in by their teams to clear snow. They wrote on Facebook ""Our crews have been working 24/7 this week to get the roads open on the Eastern Plains. Take a look at U.S. 385 after heavy snowstorms and high winds blew powder onto the roads! Luckily, our crews got out there and took care of it. Thank you for your hard work and dedication to the safety of drivers across Colorado!""

CDOT's photos show massive mounds of snow next to Highway 385, which runs north and south and parallels Colorado's eastern border. It passes through the town of Burlington, which was reporting 10 inches of snow at one point during the storm, according to First Alert Meteorologist Dave Aguilera, and may have gotten even more by the time it was all over.

Aguilera reported that a blizzard warning is posted not necessarily for the depth of snow an area gets but more for the threats posed by strong wind and visibility that comes with a powerful winter storm system.",www.cbsnews.com,Got snow?

Shell Deer Park officials have chosen not to declare a shelter-in-place as of 4:21PM, the town’s emergency update website states. Those guidelines have prompted schools to continue regularly scheduled student dismissal, citing the fact that wind is blowing the smoke away from the schools.
“Emergency officials have not called for a Shelter in Place because the wind is blowing away from the City of Deer Park and our schools. At this point, the incident is not affecting school dismissal, which is taking place according to the regular schedule,” the local school district said on its Facebook page.
Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said on Twitter the Fire Marshall will be leading the response, with multiple agencies engaging in a joint response effort.

The return to China this month of the three giant pandas at the National Zoo in Washington has raised concerns that the United States could soon have none of the beloved bears. Pandas, which are endemic to China, have been a symbol of U.S.-China friendship since Beijing sent the first two to Washington in 1972 in what is known as “panda diplomacy.”
“I was told that many American people, especially children, were really reluctant to say goodbye to the pandas, and went to the zoo to see them off,” Xi said. “I also learned that the San Diego Zoo and the Californians very much look forward to welcoming pandas back.”
Xi did not say how many pandas might be sent to the U.S. or when.
The friendly gesture came after a day of talks between Xi and President Joe Biden on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, aimed at easing fears that the world’s two biggest economies could be headed toward conflict. The four-hour summit was the first time the two leaders had spoken in a year.

They reached agreement on a number of issues such as the resumption of military-to-military communications and cooperation on counternarcotics, including curbing the flow from China of precursor chemicals and pill presses that contribute to the U.S. fentanyl crisis.
Xi then attended a dinner for U.S. business leaders, hosted by the U.S.-China Business Council and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, while Biden went to a dinner for APEC leaders.
For Xi, the dinner was a chance to court American businesses as China grapples with an economic slowdown. U.S. executives, meanwhile, were seeking insight on how to do business in an environment they see as increasingly unpredictable.
U.S. lawmakers and others had criticized those attending the dinner as ignoring China’s human rights record.
It is “unconscionable that American companies might pay thousands of dollars” to attend a dinner with Xi, said Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, citing rights abuses in the Chinese region of Xinjiang that the U.S. government has said amount to genocide. China denies the allegations.
Among the roughly 400 dinner guests were Apple CEO Tim Cook, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal and FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam. Organizers said Tesla CEO Elon Musk attended an earlier reception but was not present at the dinner.
Addressing the room, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the vast majority of the U.S. trade and investment relationship with China is not affected by national security concerns and that the U.S. is committed to promoting reciprocal trade and investment in those areas.
“A growing China that plays by the rules is in all of our interests,” she said.
Xi then spoke for more than 35 minutes, receiving a standing ovation before and after.
In a world of challenges, he said, the U.S. and China “must handle our relations well.”

China is ready to be a partner of the United States, and the world needs that relationship, Xi said, adding there was “plenty of room for our cooperation” as he rejected the view that China is a threat.
“We should build more bridges and pave more roads for people-to-people interactions,” he said. “We must not erect barriers or create a chilling effect.”
Xi said pandas had long been “envoys of friendship” between the American and Chinese people.
The departure of the National Zoo pandas left Zoo Atlanta’s four pandas as the only ones in the United States, and their loan agreement expires next year.
The San Diego Zoo has not had any giant pandas since 2019, and the last panda at the Memphis Zoo returned to China in April.
“We are ready to continue our cooperation with the United States on panda conservation,” Xi said, “and do our best to meet the wishes of the Californians so as to deepen the friendly ties between our two peoples.”",www.nbcnews.com,"Pandas may return to California, China’s Xi says",,,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/xi-jinping-china-pandas-california-biden-summit-rcna125471,2023-11-01_2023-11-30,Politics

The 37-year-old Crawford spent his first 13 seasons with San Francisco. He won four Gold Gloves and two World Series championships with the Giants.
""We're excited to be adding a player with the winning credentials and pedigree of a Brandon Crawford,"" Cardinals President of Baseball Operations John Mozeliak said in a statement. ""He is someone that will provide us with valuable depth and experience on the infield, and can also be a great resource for our younger players, such as Masyn Winn.""
Winn, who turns 22 next month, made his big league debut last year. He hit .172 (21 for 122) with two homers and 12 RBIs in 37 games with St. Louis.
Crawford was selected by San Francisco in the fourth round of the 2008 amateur draft out of UCLA. The three-time All-Star played with St. Louis sluggers Nolan Arenado and Paul Goldschmidt on the U.S. in the 2017 World Baseball Classic.
To make room for Crawford on the 40-man roster, the Cardinals designated infielder Buddy Kennedy for assignment.
Crawford appeared in 94 games in his final year in San Francisco, hitting .194 with seven homers and 38 RBIs. He had his best big league season in 2021, setting career highs with 24 homers, 90 RBIs, 11 steals and a .298 batting average in 138 games.

I’m the world’s only “eclipse journalist.” For the very latest on the “ring of fire” solar eclipse—including special travel and lodging options—please press the big blue “follow” button above or check my main feed for daily articles.
On Saturday, October 14, a solar eclipse will be seen from across the U.S. and beyond—and there will a scramble for solar eclipse glasses.
Solar eclipse glasses don’t have to be complicated. They’re widely available online and, if you know exactly where to buy them from, you can guarantee they are safe to use.
Here’s everything you need to know about buying safe solar eclipse glasses:
Who Makes Solar Protection Glasses
There are two manufacturers of solar protection glasses in the U.S.—American Paper Optics and Rainbow Symphony (the latter in conjunction with Thousand Oaks Optical). In Europe, Baader Planetarium also produces solar projection materials, but they’re not directly sold in the U.S. “They’re all equally effective and reliable,” says Chou.
How To Know If Solar Eclipse Glasses Are Safe
Products must meet the ISO 12312-2 international safety standard. They’re sold directly to the public, but also via a network of distributors and resellers. The American Astronomical Society keeps a list of Suppliers of Safe Solar Filters & Viewers and also has a primer on How Can You Tell If Your Eclipse Glasses or Handheld Solar Viewers Are Safe?
Where To Buy Safe Solar Eclipse Glasses
“Look at the list of suppliers of safe solar viewers in the eye safety section of the AAS website,” said Dr. Rick Fienberg, Project Manager, AAS Solar Eclipse Task Force at the American Astronomical Society, at a seminar on eclipse eye safety in June.
If you purchase solar eclipse glasses from a local shop then check the labeling for the logos of the main manufacturers (likely American Paper Optics or Rainbow Symphony/Thousand Oaks Optical).
Or you you get them from a major science museum or by attending a local eclipse observing event—many of which will have vendors selling safe solar eclipse glasses.
What To Do If Solar Eclipse Glasses Are Sold Out
If there are supply problems where you are then don’t panic. Don’t make your own, don’t use sunglasses and don’t use welding glass (sometimes the latter if safe, but only if it’s Grade 13 or 14, which is hard to check). All you really need to do is fine one person with a pair. “One problem we saw in 2017 was that right before the eclipse they were all sold out and people started freaking out,” said Fienberg. “But it’s not like you’re going to put these glasses on and stare at the sun for an hour—so just share them around.”
You’re not going to be tracking the moon across the sun in real-time—the occasional glance is plenty enough.
How To Avoid Counterfeit Solar Protection Glasses
Price is also key. “If you are seeing a really low price it’s probably not authentic,” says Chou, who suggests that – market forces not withstanding – the typical retail price on solar eclipse glasses and viewers is approximately $5. “If you’re paying more than that it's probably extortionate and if you're paying much less than that it’s probably a different product,” Chou. However, he points out that the price often goes up just before a solar eclipse as time gets short and people get desperate.
Just prior to the last total solar eclipse in the U.S. on August 21, 2017, controversy erupted around counterfeit eclipse glasses, with Amazon banning all sales. Many were being imported from China that were labeled as ISO-compliant without being properly tested.
What Solar Eclipse Glasses Actually Do
Received wisdom is that solar eclipse glasses protect your eyes from injury by ultraviolet and infrared radiation from the sun. That’s not actually true. “The main threat is actually the short wavelength bluish visible light – that's the stuff that's going to hurt your retina,” said Fienberg. “If you look at the solar spectrum, it peaks right where our eyes are most sensitive, a consequence of the fact that we evolved under the sun.” Short wavelength sunlight – which solar eclipse glasses reduce across most of that spectrum – doesn’t so much cause a burn as a photochemical reaction. “Usually, you can recover from it,” said Fienberg.
That’s not the case if you look at the sun through binoculars or a telescope, where the amount of sunlight being concentrated is intense. “Not only would you get a photochemical injury, but you’ll also get a retinal burn – and that you cannot recover from.”
How Solar Eclipse Glasses Are Made
There are two basic approaches to making solar eclipse glasses. “Polyester film is passed over boiling aluminum to get the aluminum-coated polyester filter materials,” says Chou. That’s what you’ll find in solar protection glasses. The other is a dark polymer material, a resin impregnated with carbon black. “It’s essentially the modern-day equivalent of smoked glass where you're just putting carbon particles into a medium,” says Chou.
The manufacturing process determines how stiff the filter is, but also what the sun will look like. “It has to do with the transmission qualities of the aluminum coating as opposed to the carbon black material,” says Chou. Aluminum will transmit primarily in the short wavelength part of the visible spectrum. Carbon absorbs virtually all of the short wavelength light, only allowing longer wavelengths of yellow and red through. “They're safe that when used as directed,” says Chou.

The U.S. Marshals Southeast Regional Fugitive Task Force said 29-year-old Chavis Demaryo Stokes was arrested at home in Montezuma, about 50 miles from the jail, around 2 p.m., the Bibb County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. The sheriff's office did not provide any other information about the arrest.
Sheriff David Davis said last week that Stokes, 52-year-old Joey Fournier, 24-year-old Marc Kerry Anderson and 37-year-old Johnifer Dernard Barnwell had escaped through a damaged window and a cut fence at the jail early Oct. 16. There was no indication Thursday that any of the others had been caught.

Video footage showed a blue Dodge Challenger that had been just outside the jail hours before the escape and appeared to show someone tampering with the fence. That person then brought some items into the enclosed area, and the sheriff said investigators believe the items were used to help the men escape.
Davis said last week that it wasn't clear whether the four men left the jail in that car or in another vehicle or whether they left on foot. The sheriff's office said the car was found abandoned Friday in the parking lot of a Macon supermarket.

Savers should closely compare their short-term CD and high-yield savings account options before getting started. Getty Images
With interest rates on savings accounts the highest they've been in years, many depositors find themselves with appealing options to choose from. High-yield savings and certificates of deposit (CD) accounts, in particular, are offering interest rates exponentially higher than what can be secured with regular savings accounts. But each account type operates differently, leading many to wonder which is better for them.
CDs, for example, come in various term lengths, at which point they will expire and the interest rate they were opened with will have changed. High-yield savings accounts, in the meantime, offer the prevailing interest rate at the time of account opening but are subject to rate changes as the economy and larger rate environment adjust. With this understanding, savers should do their research and evaluate their options to determine the best course of action.
Start by exploring CD rates here now to see how much more money you could be earning.
Short-term CD vs. high-yield savings account: Which is better?
Not sure if a short-term CD or a high-yield savings account is better for you? Here's what to know now.
When a short-term CD is better
A short-term CD is typically considered to be any CD with a term of less than 12 months. Popular short-term CD terms include three and six months. Historically, long-term CDs have had the highest interest rates, but in today's market, the highest rates are usually tied to short-term CDs. You can typically find a short-term CD with a rate of 4% to 5% or higher by shopping around online.
Short-term CDs will be better for you if you're concerned about the rate environment changing — and interest rates decreasing. Because rates on CDs are locked — and those rates are typically highest for short-term CDs — you'll earn the interest on your CD, no matter what happens during its term. They're also typically better for those who don't mind locking away their money or for those who want to protect their money from an endless cycle of deposits and withdrawals.
So if you want to earn the highest interest rate possible, and don't mind doing so for a few months or even a year, then a short-term CD may be better for you than a high-yield savings account.
Start saving - and earning more interest - with a short-term CD here now!
When a high-yield savings account is better
High-yield savings accounts operate just like regular savings accounts do, albeit with an exponentially higher interest rate. Rates on regular savings accounts are around 0.42%, according to the FDIC. But high-yield savings accounts have comparable rates to CDs, especially if you're willing to use an online bank.
A high-yield savings account is better for those who want to earn high interest but still want (or need) to access the funds. Your money won't be locked away with a high-yield account and some online banks may even provide a debit card like you already have with your regular accounts.
High-yield savings accounts may also be better over the long haul than a short-term CD will. That's because high-yield savings account rates won't end at the conclusion of any term — they'll continue to earn interest as long as you have money in the account (and as long as you meet the requirements). Yes, that rate could drop in the future, but that may be a gamble worth taking compared to the certainty that a short-term CD rate will end when the term expires.
Not sure if a high-yield savings account is worth it for you? Explore your options here now to see how much more you could be making.
The bottom line
In today's high rate environment, both CDs and high-yield savings accounts offer depositors beneficial ways to protect and grow their money. There is no definitive answer to the question of ""Which is better?"" Instead, savers need to understand their own personal financial goals and preferences. They also need to know their comfort level with locking their money away for a set time period (with CDs) or putting their money in an online bank (which may not be as accessible). Regardless of which option they choose, both short-term CDs and high-yield savings accounts are worth pursuing now, if only to earn more interest than savers would get by leaving their money untouched.",www.cbsnews.com,Short-term CD vs. high-yield savings account: Which is better?,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/short-term-cd-vs-high-yield-savings-account-which-is-better/,2023-08-01_2023-08-31,Finance

TikTok filed a lawsuit Monday challenging Montana's new statewide ban of the popular social media platform.
Why it matters: The suit, which names Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen as the defendant, alleges that the ban of the Chinese-owned app over security concerns would violate the First Amendment and other laws.
The state is already facing a First Amendment legal challenge after five TikTok creators filed a suit against the attorney general over plans to impose the ban.
Driving the news: The latest suit seeks to prevent the state from ""unlawfully"" banning the platform, which ""empowers hundreds of thousands of users in Montana to communicate and express themselves.""
TikTok alleges that Montana enacted the ""extraordinary and unprecedented measures based on nothing more than unfounded speculation,"" claiming that the state has not proven that the Chinese government can access user data.
""Montana’s ban abridges freedom of speech in violation of the First Amendment, violates the U.S. Constitution in multiple other respects, and is preempted by federal law,"" the lawsuit states.
The other side: Knudsen vowed last week to defend any legal challenges.
""TikTok is a Chinese Communist Party spying tool that poses a threat to every Montanan,"" he said, thanking Gov. Greg Gianforte and the Montana legislature ""for working with me to protect Montanans' privacy and security.""
The Montana governor's and attorney general's offices did not immediately respond to Axios' request for comment.
Catch up quick: The law, due to take effect Jan. 1, would bar downloads of TikTok in Montana.
Officials would issue a $10,000 per day fine to internet service providers and companies each time someone ""is offered the ability"" to access the platform or download the app, per the law. Users would not be fined.

Documents reveal city interacted with building, owner over 100 times in past 3 years
The city released a cache of documents and permits Wednesday evening showing a history of tenant complaints and issues plaguing 324 Main Street.
When asked by reporters during a Thursday press conference on why the building wasn't shut down despite a myriad of problems, city officials said the collapse is "" a new thing for our city"" and that they trusted a May report from an engineering firm hired by the property owner which deemed the structure safe.
Here are most damning revelations in the released documents:
There were a total of 145 interactions between the city and the property and owner Andrew Wold from 2020 to 2023
Those interactions included a variety of inspections and documented tenant complaints which spanned water coming through ceilings, faulty plumbing, no heat for months, overflowing garbage and worsening cracks in walls.
A letter dated May 24 — four days before the collapse — from engineering firm Select Structural Engineering said large patches of brick “appear ready to fall imminently.” It laid out repair recommendations “to keep the entire face of the building from falling away when the bottoms area(s) come loose.” It also said: ""The brick façade is unlikely to be preserved in place, but it can be brought down in a safe, controlled manner.""
There were five “notice to vacate letters” issued to different apartment units between 2020 to 2023 due to “substandard conditions” and after multiple inspections found issues hadn’t been fixed.
A letter from Fire Marshal Jim Morris dated March 13 said an inspection found several fire hazard issues including faulty emergency lights, fire doors that didn’t function properly, and outdated smoke detectors. The letter said: “The lack of responsiveness with this property is unacceptable.”
There were also multiple notices that city code inspectors were unable to access the building.
The building was declared a nuisance in May 2022 due to several solid waste violations. Wold was ordered to pay a $4,500 penalty after he failed to appear in court, The Associated Press reported.
A city notice dated Feb. 2 said a field inspection showed issues that needed immediate attention. It said “part of the south-west wall has been gradually failing” and “There is visible crumbling of this exterior load bearing wall under the support beam.” It also said that exterior brick veneer has separated which allowed rain and ice to build up and cause “further damage.” It said “emergency vacate orders will be posted on the building if the failing masonry area is not secured per this letter.”

Since the collapse, there's been outrage and frustration with the city's handling of the building and collapse aftermath.
A citation was filed against Wold on Tuesday in Scott County Court for failing to maintain the building in a safe and sanitary condition. The city asked for a $300 fine plus court fees.
“The city of Davenport requests that the Court order the defendant from committing any further violations of the city code provisions,” the citation said.
City Attorney Tom Warner said that the citation was filed to prevent Wold from transferring the property to avoid the demolition order.
A court date is set for June 9.
Former and recent tenants of the historic Iowa apartment building said they had complained to management for years about cracks in the walls, a lack of heat and air conditioning, and plumbing woes — but were consistently ignored.
When asked Thursday if the city should have vacated the building to prevent such a disaster, Mayor Mike Matson simply said: “I have the same anger and concern.”
Property owner cited
Wold purchased the historic property in June 2021. He issued his first public comment since the Sunday collapse on Tuesday.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with our tenants and families during this difficult time,” a statement signed by Andrew Wold and the Village Property Management team said.
“We have been working closely with the American Red Cross and other agencies to assist the displaced tenants affected by this event. We are forever grateful to them for all of their assistance with our tenants,” the brief statement said.",www.nbcnews.com,3 still unaccounted for in collapsed Iowa building as documents reveal over 100 interactions between city and property,,,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/3-still-unaccounted-collapsed-iowa-building-documents-reveal-100-inter-rcna87273,2023-06-01_2023-06-30,Natural Disasters

Now, she’s approaching her second anniversary with the man who sneaked into her camera roll before she ever knew he existed.
When she posted about her love story on TikTok, people flooded the comments section suggesting their relationship proves the “invisible string theory,” or the idea that the universe covertly connects people who are destined to meet one day. The centuries-old concept is gaining renewed traction on TikTok as young people like Harris share how they and their partners’ lives intersected multiple times before they finally met.
“It is an absolute crazy coincidence — but I think the timing for us was absolutely right, and what’s meant to be will be,” said Harris, 25, who lives in Perth, Australia.
In the comments on Harris’ video, a TikTok user claimed her husband was in the background of her childhood best friend’s home video. Another wrote that she and her husband appeared in the background of each other’s photos when she was at her ex’s college formal. And yet another said she and her husband attended the same wedding 12 years before they met.
The hashtag #invisiblestringtheory spiked last week, accruing more than a million views in the last seven days.
I believe a lot in the universe, like whatever happens, it happens for a reason. — Isabelle Whitlock, 21
Many on TikTok are using audio from Taylor Swift’s song “invisible string” — which professes that “all along there was some invisible string tying you to me” — to share their love stories. The song alludes to East Asian folklore around the “red thread of fate” that ties together lovers who are ultimately destined for each other.
Isabelle Whitlock, 21, lived less than five minutes away from her now-boyfriend all her life. They grew up in the same small town, went to the same schools and even appeared in the same yearbook photos together — but the two never met until they matched on a dating app in summer 2022.
“I believe a lot in the universe, like whatever happens, it happens for a reason,” Whitlock said. “And I think it was true for us: We met at the perfect time. If we’d met earlier, we wouldn’t have been ready for each other.”
Having experienced a string of what she described as toxic relationships, Whitlock said she could have pushed her partner, who she now believes is “the one,” away had she met him too early in life.
In her TikTok video participating in the trend, she wrote that although she doesn’t know how they went so long without meeting, they both needed to forge their own paths before their lives converged.
Whitlock and her boyfriend, Aidan Squires, who now live in Manchester, England, said they were shocked by just how widespread the phenomenon seemed to be among couples around the world.
“Now that we have a platform where you can share these sorts of things and it can be seen by pretty much anyone anywhere in the world, it makes these stories expand a lot quicker,” said Squires, 23. “It’s definitely not something we would have thought about before, but as soon as [this trend] came up, we were like, oh, my God.”",www.nbcnews.com,Taylor Swift ‘invisible string’ song lyrics inspire couples to share their love stories,,,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/viral/invisible-string-taylor-swift-inspired-tiktoks-rcna119914,2023-10-01_2023-10-31,Entertainment

A passenger traveling on a Carnival cruise ship has died while on an expedition in Vanuatu, an island country in the South Pacific Ocean.
The passenger died while snorkeling on Mystery Island, an uninhabited islet in Vanuatu, according to a report by the local news outlet 7News, citing a passenger on board. The Australian passenger was not identified in the report.
""Carnival Cruise Line is deeply saddened by the death of a guest on Mystery Island, following what appears to be a medical situation while swimming,"" Carnival Australia said in a statement, per the report, adding that the cruise line is ""supporting the guest's family along with other guests during this difficult time.""
The passenger was traveling on the Carnival Splendor cruise ship, which was scheduled for a nine-day sail in the Pacific Ocean. The cruise departed Sydney on May 15.
Five days into the cruise, the passenger died, Carnival Australia told 7News. The cruise returned to Sydney on Tuesday.

The next Carnival Splendor is scheduled to begin on May 28, according to Cruise Hive. The 12-night sail in the Pacific Ocean visits islands in New Caledonia and Vanuatu. The sail's itinerary also notes a stop at Mystery Island.
In recent years, several cruise passengers have died while snorkeling during island expeditions. In September, an American passenger on a Royal Caribbean cruise was killed after being attacked by a bull shark while snorkeling in the Bahamas.

The deposition was among hundreds of pages of mostly unredacted documents related to Jeffrey Epstein unsealed this week under the order of a judge in a now-settled defamation case brought by Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's victims.
What the documents say
In the deposition, Johanna Sjoberg alleges she was groped by Prince Andrew in 2001, when she was 21. The allegation is not new, and BBC News reports Buckingham Palace previously called her allegations ""categorically untrue.""
Sjoberg says she met Andrew when she was brought to Epstein's home in New York in 2001 by Ghislaine Maxwell. Virginia Giuffre, whose lawsuit accusing Prince Andrew of sexual abuse was settled out of court in 2022, was also at the house at the time.
Sjoberg said she initially didn't know who the British royal was, until Maxwell took her to get a caricature puppet of him from a BBC show. Then, she said, she sat on Andrew's lap, while Giuffre sat beside him on the couch with the puppet in her own lap. The group took a photo with the Prince Andrew puppet groping Giuffre's breast, and Andrew himself groping Sjoberg's.
In an excerpted transcript from a deposition of Maxwell released among the documents unsealed this week, she seemingly confirmed the existence of the puppet — which she called ""Not a puppet. I don't know how you would describe it. A caricature of Prince Andrew that was in Jeffrey's home."" When asked about the incident Sjoberg described, she said, ""I don't recollect. I recollect the puppet but I don't recollect anything around the puppet,"" before saying again it was a ""characterization of Andrew.""
Reaction in the U.K.
""We are aware of the release of court documents in relation to Jeffrey Epstein,"" London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement. ""As with any matter, should new and relevant information be brought to our attention we will assess it. No investigation has been launched.""
Virginia Giuffre accused Prince Andrew of sexually assaulting her on three separate occasions when she was 17, which were among the information included in the documents released this week. Prince Andrew denied the allegations and claimed to have no recollection of meeting Giuffre, though the two were photographed together when Giuffre was a teenager.
Graham Smith, CEO of the British anti-monarchy group Republic, said in a statement that he had reported Prince Andrew to police.
""To date there appears to have been no serious criminal investigation, no interview of the accused or other witnesses and no clear justification for taking no action,"" Smith said, calling on authorities to look into the allegations against Prince Andrew.
""Given the seriousness of the incidents, the conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell, Andrew's payment of an estimated £12m to Guiffre and the related accusations from other victims it seems there must be grounds for a full criminal investigation into these events and those involved,"" he said.",www.cbsnews.com,Details on Prince Andrew allegations emerge from new Jeffrey Epstein documents - but no U.K. police investigation,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/prince-andrew-allegations-jeffrey-epstein-documents-no-uk-police-investigation/,2024-01-01_2024-01-31,News

Israeli troops are withdrawing from Khan Yunis, the largest city in southern Gaza, a spokesperson for the Israeli Defense Force confirmed to Reuters on Sunday, raising the prospect Israel may back away from its controversial planned ground invasion into Rafah, the city where over one million Palestinians sought refuge after the war began.

Key Facts
The IDF said it had “concluded its mission” in Khan Yunis and withdrew all remaining brigades of soldiers, leaving only the Nahal Brigade and the 162nd Division of the Armored Corps stationed in the Netzarim Corridor, which divides Gaza between the North and South. The retreating soldiers will “recuperate and prepare for future operations”—which may mean the military is preparing for future conflicts with Iran, who accused Israel of bombing their consulate in Damascus last week, or Hezbollah, who Israel attacked with drone strikes on Saturday. The IDF did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Forbes, but reporters at multiple outlets confirmed troop and vehicle movements leaving the Gaza Strip on Sunday. Israel previously pulled most of its troops out of northern Gaza in January, but continued “targeted” operations in the region—including a weeks-long raid on Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City that concluded last week. On Sunday, the White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told ABC News he believes the withdrawal was designed to provide “rest and refit” for the ground troops in Gaza, and was not necessarily “indicative of some coming new operation for these troops.” Meanwhile, negotiators for both Israel and Hamas are returning to Cairo for another round of ceasefire talks—after previous attempts to reach a peace deal collapsed.
Does This Mean The Rafah Invasion Is Off?
With large numbers of troops pulling out of Khan Yunis, the IDF has fewer troops immediately ready to operate in Rafah. In March, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu authorized plans to invade the city, but held off on giving troops the green light to begin the operation. The Biden administration has consistently warned Netanyahu against operating in the beleaguered city, but Netanyahu has remained defiant. In March, the prime minister insisted the IDF would “continue to repel the pressures and we will enter Rafah, complete the elimination of the remaining Hamas battalions, restore security and bring complete victory to the people of Israel and the State of Israel.” However, the IDF’s killing of seven aid workers from the World Conflict Kitchen, including one American, has caused a larger rift in relations between the two allies. Speaking to ABC on Sunday, Kirby said “the president made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu, we’ve got to see some changes in the way they're prosecuting these operations or we’re going to have to think about making changes in our own policy towards Gaza.” Kirby said the White House was growing “increasingly frustrated” with the “way that the Israelis are acting on the ground in terms of civilian casualties,” and Biden conveyed this to Netanyahu in phone calls last week. “Now, the prime minister assured the president that he would do that. We’ve seen some announcements in those early hours. That's welcome. We’ve got to see more.” However, the IDF soldiers remaining in the Netzarim Corridor could still operate in southern Gaza—including Rafah. Sources in the military told Haaretz refugees will be able to return to their homes in Khan Yunis, but did not rule out further operations in southern Gaza.
Key Background
The announcement of the withdrawal comes one day before the six-month anniversary of the Oct. 7 attacks, which saw Hamas fighters kill about 1,200 Israelis and take 253 hostage inside the Gaza Strip. Israel invaded Gaza on Oct. 27, but primarily focused its operations in northern Gaza, especially Gaza City. In December, the IDF expanded the war into southern Gaza, forcing refugees to flee even further south to Rafah on the Egyptian border. The IDF said troops were conducting operations in Khan Yunis as late as Saturday evening. Forces in the region reportedly destroyed three tunnels underneath Khan Yunis used by militant groups, including one that allegedly crossed into Israeli territory. The military also announced they had recovered the body of Elad Katzir, one of the hostages taken at Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7. Katzir was held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another group allied with Hamas, and was killed in captivity, the military claimed.
Big Number
33,137. That’s how many Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to the most recent estimates from the Hamas-run Health Ministry. About 13,000 of those deaths are believed to be children. The IDF also announced on social media that a total of 604 Israeli soldiers have died in the fighting since the war began.

In a previous article, I discussed redefining the challenge facing companies that want to become data-driven. The way most people think about this problem—and the most commonly proposed solution—is putting all data into a single place, such as a data lake.
This strategy has challenges, the biggest of which is that while data lakes make it economical to store data, retrieval and analysis of that data can be slow and cumbersome, rendering data lakes impractical for low-latency analytics needs.
Instead, let us think about the problem simply as the need for real-time access to all relevant data across the enterprise and external sources in a way that enables building cross-sectional views and analyzing the complete set of data required to make informed decisions.
With this approach, the only requirements are: 1. the need to access data from multiple internal and external sources in real time, and 2. the ability to curate and quickly access relevant sections of this data.
In this article, I will discuss one strategy for addressing these needs: a data integration hub (DIH).
What is a data integration hub?
Data integration hubs have been around for some time and have been successfully embraced by companies with extreme data processing speed and scale requirements, especially in the financial services and insurance industries.
A DIH architecture creates a common data-access layer that aggregates different types of data from multiple on-premises, cloud-based and streaming sources. Multiple business applications can then access relevant portions of the aggregated data—ideally, cached in an in-memory data grid for real-time processing.
Underpinning the DIH architecture are several capabilities:
• A multi-model datastore with a standards-based API layer that synchronizes the data with disparate back-end sources or systems of records.
• A high-performance and scalable data access layer, supporting all forms of data-interaction APIs, including SQL; non-SQL like Java, C#, Python, Scala, etc.; or RESTful APIs.
• A data-integrity management mechanism, with something similar to ACID support.
• A strong security and access control framework to support secure and controlled data access by various audiences.
A distributed, in-memory platform that combines the features listed above would be an example of a DIH to address business needs for low-latency access to large amounts of data across the enterprise data ecosystem.
Why deploy a data integration hub?
Today, the need for extreme data processing speed and scale requirements is spreading to an ever-greater number of companies in a larger number of industries, such as healthcare, telecommunications, retail, logistics and travel, as well as many others.
The reasons for this spread are simple:
1. More data is available to enterprises through several different sources, along with the ability to process such large amounts of data quickly.
2. Within companies, the number of use cases for real-time processing tends to explode once a first use case proves successful.
3. Especially recently, nearly every company has started looking for ways to exploit AI and generative AI to accelerate innovation, improve productivity and enhance customer experiences.
A DIH architecture can help achieve these cross-sectional data access goals at scale for immense amounts of information. The DIH layer also decouples systems of record from consuming applications, allowing applications and the underlying systems to evolve at their own pace without relying on or impacting the other technology components.
This capability is fundamental to another critical initiative at many organizations: Developing the ability to move individual on-prem components to the cloud or switch cloud service providers or consumers in any way they want.
What are the limitations of a data integration hub?
By definition, a DIH creates a low-latency data access layer across multiple systems of records. Therefore, it inherently creates a separation between data read workloads (queries) and transactional data writes (changes to the data). This separation—known as the command query response segregation (CQRS)—introduces a degree of latency, as well as some complexity tied to data synchronization across two systems.
Data integration hubs are also primarily a source of cross-enterprise data, and one still has to pull data from these data integration hubs to wherever the actual processing and analysis of such data happens. This means DIHs can fall a bit short of what today’s real-time data use cases require—speed, scale and performance not only in accessing data but also in processing large amounts of data.
Conclusion
Think of the DIH as a “data bus,” similar to an enterprise service bus (ESB), that essentially creates a scalable and flexible plug-and-play architecture.
The first step to becoming data-driven is getting access to all the available data—once you have access, you have the opportunity to inspect, assess and analyze that data. If your organization is on a journey to become data-driven and facing challenges accessing data with speed and at scale, a DIH offers a potential first step as a minimally intrusive and decoupled architecture for high-speed access to the relevant data anywhere it resides.
It is also now possible to overcome the DIH limitations above. I referenced the term “enterprise data ecosystem” a couple of times in this article. In my next article, I will investigate what an enterprise data ecosystem looks like and how to address DIH limitations in order to tackle a new type of data challenge being faced by enterprises.

Barbie sold just over 460,000 tickets between 19 July, when it hit screens locally, according to the Korean Film Council. The film’s opening weekend received only an 8% share of total box office revenue and just 3.9% for the second weekend.
In comparison, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One has sold over 3.6m tickets since its release on 12 July. Pixar romance Elemental has sold more than 5.8m, making it the most successful foreign film of the year, after it opened on 14 June.
South Korean women’s rights activist Haein Shim said the film’s themes might have turned off cinema-goers. “I think Barbie undoubtedly highlights the fact that a women-centred film with feminist humour is still regarded as a taboo subject.
“Women might be hesitant to go watch the film. The fear of being labelled as a feminist in South Korea is real.
“The word ‘feminism’ has become a dirty word to a lot of individuals in Korea, and people are unwilling to recognise – and are uncomfortable confronting – the deeply rooted patriarchy that has driven society for so long,” she said.
South Korea remains deeply patriarchal and scores poorly for gender equality among advanced nations. The country has the worst gender pay gap among OECD countries and has consistently ranked last on the Economist’s Glass Ceiling Index, which measures where women have the best and worst chances of equal treatment at work.
Women often face strong societal pressures to give up their careers after childbirth, and sex crimes against women are rampant in a criminal justice system that often appears to give light sentences to perpetrators.
Yoon Suk Yeol, now the country’s president, disavowed the label of feminist when he was running for office. He has previously suggested feminism was to blame for the country’s birthrate, currently the world’s lowest, and stated that South Korea has “no structural gender discrimination”.
Film critic Youn Sung-Eun said South Koreans may agree on gender equality in principle, but there are factions within the conservative society that strongly oppose what they perceive as “radical feminism”.
“In this context, Greta Gerwig’s gender equality education is not very appealing,” said Youn, who has completed a doctorate in film studies, on some of the potential reasons for its underperformance. “Since Barbie is intended to be an entertaining movie, presenting such sensitive themes prominently might not resonate well.”
Ahead of Barbie’s release, localised Korean versions of the posters were missing the original iconic slogans “Barbie is everything” and “He’s just Ken”. They were simplified to and showed only the characters’ names. This sparked criticism for allegedly undermining the film’s female-empowering message. After the criticism emerged in April, Warner Brothers Korea said the move was not intentional and that it had focused on just the images and names of the character during the early stages of its promotional campaign.
In recent years, feminism in South Korea has morphed into a negative concept associated with radical behaviour, a perception that has gained traction in popular male-dominated online communities, and now in wider society.
According to a 2019 survey by local media outlet SisaIN, 62.3% of men in their 20s do not believe feminism is a movement to achieve gender equality. Some 78.9% of men in their 20s agreed with a statement that it was about “female supremacy”.
South Korea was ranked 99th out of 146 countries in the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index in 2022.

Local female-led films still a drawcard
Jason Bechervaise, a local film critic and researcher into the Korean film industry, said the underperformance of Barbie compared with western markets was not surprising.
“Some female-driven films have struggled locally, and anti-feminists will undoubtedly attack such films, but I don’t see this as the only reason Barbie is not performing here,” he told the Guardian.
“In fact, the locally produced Smugglers, which features a big female cast, is topping the local box office,” he said, referring to the crime action film about freediving women who lose their jobs and turn to smuggling. The film has already attracted more than 2 million viewers since coming out on 26 July.
“Korea is a unique market – some films like Elemental overperform, while others do the opposite, which we are seeing with Barbie. This is also true of films like Star Wars, which are closely connected to American popular culture but do not perform well here.”

The prize is the world's ninth-largest lottery prize behind earlier drawings of Powerball and Mega Millions, the other nearly nationwide lottery game. The jackpot is the fourth-largest in the history of Powerball.
Powerball drawings happen weekly on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday nights, beginning at 10:59 p.m. ET at the Florida Lottery draw studio in Tallahassee.
The prize has grown so massive because no one has matched all five white balls and the Powerball to win the jackpot in 32 consecutive drawings, dating back to July 19.
That losing streak reflects the stunningly long odds of winning the jackpot, at 1 in 292.2 million.
The $1.04 billion jackpot is for a sole winner who chooses to receive the winnings through an annuity, paid annually over 30 years. Winners nearly always pick the cash option, which for Monday night's drawing would be an estimated $478.2 million.
A Powerball ticket costs $2 in most states and players can pick their own numbers or have a computer make the selection.

Senior Chinese diplomat Li Hui will travel to Europe as China’s “special representative” to the conflict, in a bid to help bring about a cease-fire and ultimately a resolution to the war, which is threatening to descend into a bloody stalemate.
For Moscow, Li is “the best possible choice” for someone to mediate talks with Ukraine, according to Alexey Maslov, the director of The Institute of Asian and African Studies of the Moscow State University.
“Moscow will not be worried because he really understands Russian politics,” according to Maslov, who says he has known Li personally for 10 years.
Li was until 2019 China’s ambassador to Moscow, and has decades of diplomatic experience in the Soviet Union, before its collapse, and its remnants in the years afterward. He is a renowned Russophile and a fluent Russian speaker, among the few foreigners awarded the prestigious Medal of Friendship by President Vladimir Putin.
Today he is Beijing’s special representative for Eurasian Affairs.
Li enjoys reading great Russian writers such as Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoevsky, Maslov said, adding, “He really understands the Russian soul, he understands the Russian psychology, the Russian mentality.”
For his part, Li has often praised the Sino-Russian relationship. Four years after he wrote in a 2016 Russian Foreign Ministry newspaper article that China needs a ""powerful Russia"" he composed a 2020 essay for the Communist Party-affiliated Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs, which said Beijing and Moscow would stand “back-to-back and shoulder-by-shoulder.”
“The two sides will, as always, show firm support for each other’s efforts to uphold one’s own sovereignty, security, territorial integrity and other core interests,” he wrote.

Russia is increasingly reliant on that support.
Sanctioned and condemned after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Russia invaded Ukraine last year expecting to swiftly depose or defenestrate the government of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Instead, its poorly equipped and led forces were beaten back by highly motivated and Western-backed Ukrainian troops, which reclaimed much of the ground initially occupied by the Russians.
Li’s expected visit to several European countries may be a bid to allay concerns concerns about about where Beijing’s diplomatic loyalties lie given that China has previously heralded its “no limits” partnership with Russia, lent it rhetorical and financial support and refused to condemn the February 2022 invasion.
It is an uneven partnership.
Sanctions have pushed Russia to rely further on China, selling it record amounts of oil that has allowed it to soften the economic storm imposed by its global pariah status. Beijing has in turn been able to exert an increasing amount of leverage on Moscow, cementing a key ally in the geopolitical confrontation with the U.S.
In Li, China is sending to Ukraine “certainly someone well-versed in relevant affairs and capable of playing a positive role in facilitating talks for peace,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a briefing on Thursday. “China will continue to work with the international community to play a constructive role for the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis.”
Indeed, Li’s deep knowledge on Russia “should not necessarily be seen as working in favor of Russia, but more as a tentative of appointing somebody who can interpret accurately China’s position,” said Zeno Leoni, who lectures in defense studies at King’s College London. He will “understand where mediation is possible and where not between Russia and Ukraine.”
Ukraine's government itself has stayed positive publicly about Li. Ukraine hopes that Li’s “deep knowledge of our region will help him to communicate impartially and effectively with all parties,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko told NBC News in a statement.
To be truly successful in brokering peace, Li will have to bring both sides to the negotiating table. So far, the two sides are far from this point.
Ukraine has demanded the complete restoration of its territorial integrity, including Russian-annexed Crimea, payments of war damages and punishment for war criminals.
While the Russians have not recently stated their objectives at any negotiations, officials have said they would accept nothing less than the full demilitarization of Ukraine, no accession to NATO and the regions that have referendums to join Russia remain part of Russia.
Sending Li as an envoy “doesn’t help bridge that gap” in trust between Ukraine and China, Michael Horowitz, the head of intelligence at Bahrain-based risk management consultancy, Le Beck International, said in an email.
“Beijing may feel its ties with Russia will eventually be viewed in a more positive light, if and when Ukraine is ready to talk,” he added.
China is playing a “long-game here, trying to position itself as a ‘peacemaker,’ to appeal to Europe among others,” Horowitz said. “They understand this is a long-shot, but they bet that at some point talks are inevitable, and are throwing their hat in the ring.”
Li also has met officials from other post-Soviet states that have more testy relationships with Russia, a sign that Beijing wants to carve its own place internationally and will not be dictated to by Moscow.
Last year he visited Beijing’s Georgian embassy — a country that fought a war with Russia in 2008 — and said their nations “have always respected each other and treated each other as equals,” according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry website.
And in 2005 he met with a Ukrainian delegation to Beijing, the website’s records show, and said that “China would like to enhance cooperation with Ukraine to jointly promote the continuous development of bilateral relations.” This was a time when Ukraine was run by a pro-Western government.
These efforts at outreach do not appear to have paid off, yet. Western officials are so far skeptical of Beijing’s claims to be a neutral peace broker.
“Thus far, China has not shown itself to be unbiased when it comes to supporting Russia,” a senior Biden administration official said this week after a call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Zelenskyy.
Skepticism from Ukraine and their Western allies was always likely, Michele Geraci, a professor at the U.K.’s University of Nottingham, said Friday.
But for Beijing, Li was a pragmatic choice because the war “has created problems for China which trades with both Ukraine and Russia,” he said, adding, “They want to go back to business with the rest of the world.”
Li, he said, was someone who knows Russia and can negotiate with Ukraine. “At the end of the day, war is won by the strongest army, not by rule of law unfortunately,” he added.",www.nbcnews.com,China's peace envoy to Ukraine has close ties to Russia,,,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/china-peace-envoy-ukraine-war-li-hui-russia-putin-rcna81937,2023-05-01_2023-05-31,Military

""Whether it be wildfires or earthquakes, the city is prepared,"" Mayor Karen Bass said during a news conference at City Hall on Friday, surrounded by the general managers of several city departments. ""We're not waiting for the storm to hit. We have already began working 24/7 to be ahead of the curve and to be ready as soon as the storm reaches our shores.""
Hilary was at Category 2 status in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Baja California on Saturday afternoon, and is expected to hit the city early Sunday and continue through Monday. Hilary is expected to weaken to a tropical storm by the time it reaches the Southland, but forecasters are still warning of heavy rain, wind and a high risk of flooding.
""This morning, I was briefed by the National Weather Service about the coming storm,"" Bass posted Saturday on X, formerly Twitter. ""Angelenos should take this storm seriously — stay SAFE and stay INFORMED. Follow @NWSLosAngeles , @ReadyLA and @NotifyLA for updates as we continue to prepare for #HurricaneHilary.""
Bass said Friday that she received a call from Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas to let her know he will be available 24/7 as the city weathers the storm. The city has federal support on hand ""should we need it,"" she added.

The state's Emergency Management Department will activate its Emergency Operation Center to monitor and manage any incidents and impacts on the city, as well.
""311 will be expanding operating hours if there is a high call volume. LAFD Fire Chief (Kristin) Crowley will oversee the Emergency Operations Center. The fire department is fully staffed to respond to this potential rainfall as it impacts, and teams are coordinating and collaborating across the city,"" Bass said.
California's National Guard contingent has also ""strategically pre- positioned resources throughout Southern California"" as part of the statewide effort to prepare for the storm, officials said Saturday.
The Department of Water and Power has restoration crews fully staffed and ready to respond to any power outages. Streets L.A., L.A. Sanitation and the Department of Transportation are taking steps to ensure roads are operational -- before, during and after the storm -- according to Bass.
""The city of Los Angeles is working with Los Angeles Housing Services Authority to identify resources citywide that can be used for Angelenos experiencing homelessness during the storm,"" Bass said. ""Recreation and parks facilities have been pre-identified should evacuation and our shelters be needed.""
Animal shelters and specialized rescue teams are ready to respond to evacuations or rescue in the event of such incidents in the city. The central library will be providing rain ponchos and T-shirts to patrons while supplies last.
""As the city prepares, we need Angelenos to prepare. Angelenos should register for Notify LA for local alerts regarding the storm. Angelenos can follow at ReadyLA on social media channels for event developments and general resources to stay informed,"" Bass said.
The mayor urged Angelenos to stay away from the shoreline and beaches throughout the duration of the storm.

Hurricane safety tips and resources can viewed at noaa.gov/hurricane- prep. In the event of a life threatening emergency, Angelenos should call 911.
For impacts such as roadway flooding, tree limbs blocking roads or mudslides, Angelenos should request service online or by calling 311.
In the event of power outages or water main breakages, DWP customers can call 800-DIAL-DWP (342-5397).
""There is a reason why our resources are dispatched worldwide to respond to disaster,"" Bass said. ""We will be prepared and as always, we will be in coordination with the city, county, state and federal levels as we move forward.""
Carol Parks, general manager of the city's Emergency Management Department, said the tropical storm will bring winds from 39 to 73 mph, and possible isolated rain and thunderstorms could begin as soon as Saturday afternoon.

Winds will increase Sunday evening with a flood watch in effect through 11 p.m. On Monday, the region is expected to receive anywhere from two to four inches of rain, totaling across L.A. County, with up to seven inches possible in the San Gabriel Mountains and foothills.
There could be major roadway flooding, which could be a concern for the metro area with a change of elevated surf and some coastal flooding, Parks said.
Crowley said Angelenos can pick up free ready-to-fill sandbags at neighborhood fire stations.
Alfred Labrada, assistant chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, urged Angelenos to stay informed, prepare and to adhere to evacuations.
Aram Benyamin, chief operating officer for DWP, reminded everyone to be patient as crews address power outages, and to stay away from any fallen power lines.
""We have been doing inspections of our infrastructure, as we anticipate high levels of (water) flow. So, we have made arrangements for the water flow from our northern aqueduct and reservoirs that we have in town, and we are ready to make sure that the flows are not impacting our infrastructure,"" Benyamin said. ""We have resources on the ground to make sure that infrastructure restoration is going to be taking place and make sure that the system can withstand the needs of the city.""
The looming storm has prompted a slew of cancelations throughout the Southland. City officials announced Saturday that all county parks, buildings and facilities would be closed Sunday and Monday, including, but not limited to:
Picnic shelters;
Playgrounds;
Multi-use trails;
Restrooms;

Until the 1990s, that idea was no more than a hypothesis. By then, telescopes had become sufficiently advanced to reveal the hard evidence: A star about 50 light-years away was wobbling, a sign that a small world was tugging on it. This world was called an exoplanet.
Astronomers have since discovered more than 5,300 exoplanets and counting, and they’re studying the atmosphere of these worlds to determine if the molecules suspended in their clouds could sustain life. They’ve even recently captured evidence of an exoplanet getting swallowed up by its dying star. (Truly, telescopes have gotten really good.) Although most people probably can’t name an exoplanet—something like “HD 108236 b” doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue—the fact that the cosmos is full of them is now well known.
The exo- prefix extends beyond the realm of planets. Astronomers have found exoauroras, exoasteroid belts, and even exorings, such as the ones that surround Saturn. Exomoons haven’t been proved to exist, but astronomers believe that they are more numerous than exoplanets themselves. The search for such celestial objects and structures has intensified in recent years. Just this week, astronomers announced that they have found an exoradiation belt, an invisible cocoon of charged particles, held in place by a planet’s magnetic field. We are firmly in the era of exothings.
Read: Faraway planets don’t seem so distant anymore
There is plenty of scientific possibility in the discovery of exothings, and also comfort. Not to be dramatic, but Earth is a small island in an endless sea. Ours is a cosmically lonely existence. So it’s nice to look out across that sea, dark and unknowable, and occasionally spot other islands, other familiar shores. The study of exothings is a way of conversing with the rest of the cosmos and saying, “Oh, you’ve got one of those too?” And because any hypothetical life must live somewhere, exothings could someday answer one of our most existential questions: Are we alone?
When Melodie Kao, an astronomer at UC Santa Cruz, went looking for exothings, she set her sights 20 light-years away, on a brown dwarf—a rather unusual object that is neither a star nor a planet, with a mass somewhere between the two. Kao had previously studied this particular brown dwarf and found that its intense radio emissions produced auroras similar to our own northern lights. She couldn’t account for what was causing the aurora, so she turned to our own solar system for inspiration, and realized that planets with auroras also have radiation belts. No one had ever found one outside the solar system before. But when Kao went looking for one around her brown dwarf, voilà, there it was: a radiation belt, invisible to the human eye but billowing in radio wavelengths, in all its exoglory.
Exoasteroid belts are downright stunning, particularly in infrared wavelengths. Astronomers recently used the most powerful observatory in operation, the James Webb Space Telescope, to observe a star about 25 light-years away with a known asteroid belt. They were surprised to find not one single ring of material, but three. The dusty region was likely shaped by the same forces that produced the versions in our own solar system: the movements of planets, hidden somewhere in those concentric rings. “It’s sort of comforting that the same processes likely play out, to some extent, very similarly,” Andras Gaspar, an astronomer at the University of Arizona who led the observations, told me. Perhaps, he added, we’re “not the only ones who are deciphering how our universe works.”
An exoasteroid belt (NASA / ESA / CSA / A. Gaspar (University of Arizona) / A. Pagan (STScI))
Although the universe is full of repeats, each iteration brings its own little quirks. The exoradiation belt that Kao discovered, for example, is “almost 10 million times more intense” than Earth’s, Kao said. The exoasteroid belt is far more complex than our main asteroid belt, between Mars and Jupiter, as well as the Kuiper Belt farther out, a region beyond Neptune of icy objects and dust. And the only known set of exorings is 200 times larger than Saturn’s—possibly because it sits around a young sunlike star, not a planet.
Some exothings have proved elusive, even though astronomers would bet all the money in the universe that they exist. Exomoons are one of them: Our solar system is full of moons, so others must be too. But no one’s been able to prove they exist. In 2018, a pair of astronomers said they had found evidence of what could be the first-known exomoon, orbiting a planet around a star 8,000 light-years from here. But when other teams took up the same data and conducted their own analyses, they got mixed results. The search continues.

It continues as well for that most elusive exothing: a truly Earthlike planet, nice and rocky, with a chemically rich atmosphere and temperatures that would allow water to lap on the surface. Mansi Kasliwal, an astronomy professor at Caltech who was involved in the discovery of the unfortunate exoplanet consumed by its star, told me she thinks a lot about the idea of an exohome. Not another place in the universe where humans might relocate (though she hopes future generations take a crack at that before our sun swallows our own planet in a few billion years), but some other speck out there where life managed to emerge and thrive. “It doesn’t even have to be identical to Earth,” she said. “It just needs to be habitable and hospitable, a planet that is home to some species.”
Our collection of exothings large and small is growing every year. “Until recently, I had a lot of exoplanet envy,” says Jackie Villadsen, a physics and astronomy professor at Bucknell University who worked with Kao. “Now we can do exoradiation belts.” Compared with exoplanets—which can have oceans of lava and raindrops made of glass—radiation belts might seem a little boring. But exothings, whatever they are, lend themselves to daydreaming. Consider the exoasteroid belt that Gaspar studies. The star at its center is about 440 million years old, much younger than our approximately 4.6-billion-year-old sun. When our sun was that age, Earth was still lifeless. “It’s very doubtful that any life could have emerged, let alone sophisticated, intelligent life forms,” Gaspar said.
But maybe sometime in the cosmic future, a spark will flash. Someday, perhaps, a group of beings on a planet inside that system will dispatch little robots into the depths, to the other planets and moons nearby. They will sprinkle signs of their existence beyond their cozy atmosphere, all the way out to their asteroid belt and beyond.

In July 2019, at 16 years old, Jasson Dominguez signed a contract that included a franchise-record, $5.1 million signing bonus for an international free agent, a bet on the player and his character.
In the hours afterward, Dominguez returned to Ivan Noboa’s Baseball Dreams Academy, where he had trained, and gave away the majority of his equipment to the kids he was leaving behind. It was one more sign to Yankees director of international scouting Donny Rowland that Dominguez had everything the club was looking for in a player.
“It’s very rare to see that combination,” Rowland said over the phone. “You look at tools, athleticism, makeup, performance as an amateur — and the analytical data backed up everything. He checked every box.”
Dominguez’s dream came true on Friday, when he went 1-for-4 with a home run in his major league debut at Minute Maid Park, and it was special for the personnel who scouted him, too.

Now 20, Dominguez might be the most hyped Yankees prospect of all time, a switch-hitting center fielder who has been compared to Mickey Mantle.
The legend, Rowland said, began during a simulated game in the Dominican Republic when Dominguez was “maybe 14.” Rowland watched and tried to keep a straight face, so as not to betray his leanings to rival scouts in attendance, as Dominguez crushed home runs from both sides of the plate, showed excellent speed and played like no 14-year-old he had seen.
“It was difficult to stop from laughing under my breath and tipping my hand,” Rowland said before the Yankees’ 6-2 win over the Astros. “It was kind of like: Are you kidding me? At that age, to have that kind of tools. I’ve never seen that kind of tools for someone that age before.”
He asked a couple of Yankees scouts whether they had seen such a performance from Dominguez and was told by one, “I’ve actually seen him a little better.”
Thus began an information-gathering process that included Rowland watching the teenager play on at least 30 different occasions, ensuring what he was seeing was real.
And thus began the process of discovering the type of person the young Dominguez was becoming. His makeup was “impeccable,” Rowland said, and it had to be to keep the comparisons and the hype and the money from going to his head.
The Yankees used about 90 percent of their international pool money on Dominguez, choosing one potential superstar over a deeper class that could have produced dozens of lottery tickets. It was a rarity for the organization at the time, but has become a recent trend. The Yankees splurged for $4 million on shortstop Roderick Arias in 2022 and $4.4 million on outfielder Brando Mayea this year.
The Yankees, who routinely have among the lowest bonus pools, still fight to the top of the market.
“There’s a player every now and then that jumps out as the clear No. 1 player in the market,” Rowland said. “There’s no reason for us not to get the best player in the market. … Jasson made it very easy for us to step up.”
They stepped up and signed Dominguez, whose nickname the club does not want credit for.
After the signing, “Many teams walked up to me and said, ‘You got to be kidding me,’ ” Rowland said. “One of the guys from a team said, ‘You got The Martian — the guy from Mars.’ ”",nypost.com,Jasson Dominguez ‘checked every box’ for Yankees before record deal,,,https://nypost.com/2023/09/02/jasson-dominguez-checked-every-box-for-yankees-before-record-deal/,2023-09-01_2023-09-30,Sports

Hundreds of people were stuck on a beach Saturday waiting to be evacuated as a fleet of Greek coast guard boats and private vessels, the BBC reported.
More than 200 firefighters and 40 fire engines were dispatched to the island from as far away as Slovakia to help extinguish the fires.
Greek navy vessels were also on their way in what firefighters called the worst fires they had seen in the region. No injuries were reported, according to the Greek Ministry of Climate Crisis and Civil Protection.

One British woman said she was evacuated from the hotel she was staying at with her sister and daughter, but was stuck on a beach with hundreds of people awaiting rescue.

Heading to a small zoo in Binghamton, New York, is probably not on many out-of-town travelers’ itineraries. Maybe it should be. The second annual Lantern Festival at Ross Park Zoo is, pardon the pun, quite illuminating, or, better yet, quite a spectacle.
It’s a nighttime spectacle perfect for families with young children or for grandparents bringing the grandkids. But, with the kid in all of us, you don’t need to bring children to enjoy 40-plus neon lantern sculptures playfully positioned throughout the zoo.

The lantern sculptures are a mix of lovable animals, scary creepy crawlers and ferocious dinosaurs. Some have movement, and their colors are brilliant and varied. The zoo’s natural setting, tucked into the northern face of Binghamton’s South Mountain, adds to the display, as colored lights illuminate rock faces and trees.
“The lush surroundings and scenic beauty create a captivating environment for the lanterns to stand out, adding to the enchanting atmosphere of the event,” says Evelyn Hale, the zoo’s director of visitor experience. “The darkness of the wooded area further accentuates the brilliance of the lantern displays, creating a magical ambiance that immerses visitors in the lantern festival's wonder.”
It took about three weeks to set up the lantern sculptures. The work was done by Tianyu Arts and Culture, a company specializing in lantern festivals and art installations.

The three-week setup “ensured that each lantern was meticulously placed, and the entire display was ready for the event,” Hale says.
During the setup, there were several technical difficulties that posed challenges.
“One of the main challenges was the limited availability of outlets and power sources along the zoo path,” Hale recalls. “Additionally, the varied terrain of the zoo grounds required careful planning and adjustments to ensure the lanterns were securely installed. Coordinating the setup schedules with the zoo's daytime operations and accommodating large work vehicles further added to the complexity of the task.”

Lantern festivals, Hale says, are becoming increasingly popular at U.S. zoos. The festival at the Ross Park Zoo attracted 17,000 visitors last year and runs through Oct. 29 this year. The admission charge is $20 for adults and $15 for children ages 3-12.
The animals at the Binghamton zoo are in darkness and cannot be seen by nighttime visitors to the lantern festival. Are there concerns about the lanterns' effects on the animals?
“Ensuring the well-being of our animals is of utmost importance,” Hale says. “To address concerns about the lanterns' effects on the animals, we provided blinds to create shaded areas and reduce direct light exposure during nighttime hours. Additionally, our staff actively educates visitors about the animals' need for rest and the importance of minimizing disturbances during their natural resting periods.”

The Binghamton zoo opened in 1875 and is “the fifth-oldest zoological institution in the country behind such communities as Philadelphia, Chicago, Cincinnati and Buffalo,” according to the zoo’s website.
The zoo says it “is dedicated to promoting awareness and stewardship of our natural world, in our community and globally, through education, conservation and community engagement.”",www.forbes.com,Lantern Festival Illuminates The Binghamton Night,,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/garystoller/2023/09/09/lantern-festival-illuminates-the-binghamton-night/,2023-09-01_2023-09-30,Science

The summit Tuesday and Wednesday in the Brazilian city of Belem is a meeting of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization, a toothless, 45-year-old alliance that has met only three times before.
The Amazon stretches across an area twice the size of India, and two-thirds of it lies in Brazil. Seven other countries and one territory share the remaining third — Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, Ecuador and French Guiana. Presidents from all but Ecuador, Suriname and Venezuela are attending.
Massive destruction of the Amazon forest is a climate disaster and all the countries at the summit have ratified the Paris climate accord which requires signatories to set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But that’s about as far as their shared policy goes.
Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has said he hopes the Belem summit will awaken the long-dormant organization.
“I have great expectation that, for the first time, we will have a common policy for action in the Amazon,” Lula told foreign correspondents in the capital Brasilia Aug. 2.
It’s Lula’s second attempt to form an Amazon bloc. He tried back when the last Amazon summit was held in 2009, during his first presidency, but was joined by only one other president from the region, Bharrat Jagdeo of Guyana. Then French President Nicolas Sarkozy also attended. Then as now, the goal was to present a united Amazon during annual climate talks known as COP in Copenhagen. It failed.
“The context is totally different today,” Brazil’s Environment and Climate Change Minister Marina Silva told The Associated Press. “President Lula is very determined that this summit will not be just another event with no real outcomes for the decisions that will be announced here.”
Silva said the event goes beyond the climate talks and will also address how countries will prevent the Amazon from reaching a tipping point, in which the former forest releases carbon dioxide out of control. According to some scientists, this will happen when 20% to 25% of the forest is destroyed. The resulting decline in rainfall would transform more than half of the Amazon to tropical savannah, with immense biodiversity loss.
Forest protection commitments so far have been uneven. Brazil and Colombia have pledged to stop deforestation completely by 2030, but other countries are reluctant to follow.
Notable goals include:
Brazil: Lula has said he will create 14 new Indigenous territories, and has already created six. He also said he will restore Brazil’s official climate commitment, 37% lower emissions by 2025 than in 2005, which was weakened under his predecessor. But it’s just a promise and has not been formalized.
Colombia: Gustavo Petro’s government has laid out a 30-year strategy for reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, and reducing its greenhouse gases by 51%.
Ecuador: President Guillermo Lasso has said that he will lead his country through an ecological transition to zero carbon emissions by 2050. By 2025, the nation aims to reduce deforestation to avoid 15 million metric tons (16.5 million tons) of emissions. Ecuador also hopes to create a bio-corridor that allows animals to roam over distances, foreign minister Gustavo Manrique said earlier this year.
Colombian President Gustavo Petro has sought to position himself as a leader in global climate efforts and protection of the Amazon. At a recent meeting in the Colombian town of Leticia, environment ministers from the eight countries agreed to come up with a joint strategy to prevent the Amazon from reaching a “point of no return.” Petro has also spoken of the need to shift away from hydrocarbons, one of the main causes of climate change, yet oil is one of his nation’s chief exports.
Addressing organized crime
Peru is seeking not just a declaration aimed at slowing the collapse of the Amazon, but agreements to fight drug trafficking and other illegal activities.
To face the threat the countries share from organized crime, Lula has already announced that Brazil will create a center for international police cooperation in Manaus, the largest city in the Amazon. The announcement underscored governments’ realization that isolated raids and crackdowns have been ineffective.
“You’re seeing a creeping recognition ... of the importance of addressing crime in the Amazon,” said Rob Muggah, co-founder of the Igarape Institute, a security-focused think tank. But the effort hasn’t been serious yet, he added. “We’re still tackling it with band-aids.”
Cross-border cooperation in the Amazon has historically been scant, undermined by low trust, ideological differences and the lack of government presence. But budding environmental consciousness and widespread recognition of the Amazon’s importance in arresting climate change has invigorated the drive for a paradigm shift.
There have already been encouraging signs. In 2018, Latin American nations signed the Escazu Agreement which established the public’s right to environmental information and participation in decision-making, and protected environmentalists. However, several countries, including Brazil, have not yet ratified it. The following year, they signed the Leticia Pact to better coordinate environmental protection.
Lula said he hopes a “Belem Declaration” — already drafted — will become the nations’ shared call to arms as they move toward the global climate conference in November in Dubai.
This summit also reinforces Lula’s strategy to leverage global concern for the Amazon’s preservation. Emboldened by a 42% drop in deforestation during his first seven months in office, he has sought international financial support for forest protection. The leaders of Norway and Germany, large contributors to Brazil’s Amazon Fund for sustainable development, were invited, as were counterparts from other crucial rainforest regions: Indonesia, Republic of Congo, and Democratic Republic of Congo.
Outside the official summit, some 20,000 Indigenous people and others from different Amazon countries have scheduled 400 parallel events. In hours-long sessions, they presented demands to ministers mostly from Brazil, but also Colombia, Peru and other countries. A summary of these discussions will be presented to the assembled presidents, including a proposal to ban new oil production in the region.
“I had never seen a meeting so big to discuss the preparation for a COP,” rubber-tapper leader Manoel Cunha, 55, told the AP, noting that even at major events ministers are usually thin on the ground. “A meeting of this magnitude, with Indigenous peoples, family farmers, riverine communities, fishermen, and Afro-Brazilians, with such a presence of national and international authorities, is unprecedented,” he said.
Ahead of the summit, Gisela Padovan, Brazil foreign secretary for Latin America and the Caribbean, noted the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization has only 17 employees, but presidents in Belem aim to build it out. She said there was a commitment to coordinate future action through the group.
Asked whether he was optimistic about concrete decisions and action coming from the summit, reknowned Indigenous leader Raoni Metuktire told the AP he intends to speak with presidents and make clear they effectively have no choice.
“They have to make this deforestation stop. What I am going to say is that if the presidents do not take any measure, they are going to have serious environmental problems,” he said Monday through an intepreter, speaking his native Kayapo language at an Indigenous emcampment. “Natural disasters will be a problem for all us human beings.”",www.nbcnews.com,Eight Amazon rainforest countries begin first summit in 14 years,,,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/eight-amazon-rainforest-countries-begin-first-summit-14-years-rcna98744,2023-08-01_2023-08-31,Environment

There are so many strong sources of AI governance, and ethical guidelines, principles or policies. Currently, this is an area fraught with complexity, redundancy as each country is creating their own AI governance, and ethical frameworks to advance their own jurisdiction needs. Although democratic jurisdictions are communicating in collaborative governing bodies within OECD, or the EU, the reality is international AI legislative frameworks are not yet unified and remains a work in progress. What is good, however, is that everyone in a democratic country seems to be very aligned with the OECD guidelines that were initiated in 2016. Now that we are fast approaching 2024, already nearly a decade has passed and our legislative bodies are still working on their governance positions.
Perhaps an AI Generative Bot could do this so much faster than all of us humans? Makes you wonder?
The information collected below provides a wealth of knowledge on the breadth of perspectives but also the repetitiveness in key AI ethical constructs that are encouraging but also daunting. There is no question that all publicly traded companies will need to have an AI Ethicist familiar with the diverse geo-political AI legislation. This will undoubtedly be a critical skill to have on a Board of Directors and within larger organizations to keep abreast of this rapidly developing field.
Below are a number of helpful sources to support your learning journey on AI governance and AI Ethics.
I no doubt have missed many other countries and noteworthy research sources. Here is another helpful list I found. I will summarize the most important principles from these research sources and frame into some helpful board director or C Level questions that you can ask on ensuring your organization is AI Ready to Govern with Responsible and Trusted AI Practices.
Stay tuned, as I expect this will take me a while to do well.
In the meantime, you need to know that there are many emerging AI legislation frameworks on top of this information that is framing legislation in all jurisdictions and politicians, governments and society are concerned about the flurry of AI innovation and potential risks to jobs, and society at large without more sufficient guard rails in place. What is clear is that third party AI audits will soon come into effect for all high risk applications - a boon to the auditing firms.
As I am teaching AI Ethics and Law and a board advisor to a few international organizations advancing education or market research on AI , I love it when my readers want to speak about their challenges in advancing their AI Strategy and Governance systems to be more AI Risk Ready.
The best way to reach me is on my LinkedIn. You can also see our company’s AI Ethics Policy here as every company needs one. Just ensure you have your own lawyer review it.
